QUESTION TITLE:

Snowflake Tree

DIFFICULTY:

QUESTION CONTENT:
--------------------
A "Snowflake Tree" is defined as a tree that can be generated by the following procedure:

- Choose positive integers x,y.
- Prepare one vertex.
- Prepare x more vertices, and connect each of them to the vertex prepared in step 2.
- For each of the x vertices prepared in step 3, attach y leaves to it.

The figure below shows a Snowflake Tree with x=4,y=2. The vertices prepared in steps 2, 3, 4 are shown in red, blue, and green, respectively.

You are given a tree T with N vertices. The vertices are numbered 1 to N, and the i-th edge (i=1,2,\dots,N-1) connects vertices u_i and v_i.
Consider deleting zero or more vertices of T and the edges adjacent to them so that the remaining graph becomes a single Snowflake Tree. Find the minimum number of vertices that must be deleted. Under the constraints of this problem, it is always possible to transform T into a Snowflake Tree.

Input

The input is given from Standard Input in the following format:
N
u_1 v_1

u_{N-1} v_{N-1}

Output

Print the answer.

Constraints
