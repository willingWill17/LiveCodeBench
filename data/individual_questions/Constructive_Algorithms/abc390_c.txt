QUESTION TITLE:
--------------------
Paint to make a rectangle

DIFFICULTY:
--------------------
medium

QUESTION CONTENT:
--------------------
You are given a grid of H rows and W columns.
Let (i,j) denote the cell at row i (1 \leq i \leq H) from the top and column j (1 \leq j \leq W) from the left.
The state of the grid is represented by H strings S_1, S_2, \ldots, S_H, each of length W, as follows:

- If the j-th character of S_i is #, cell (i,j) is painted black.
- If the j-th character of S_i is ., cell (i,j) is painted white.
- If the j-th character of S_i is ?, cell (i,j) is not yet painted.

Takahashi wants to paint each not-yet-painted cell white or black so that all the black cells form a rectangle.
More precisely, he wants there to exist a quadruple of integers (a,b,c,d) (1 \leq a \leq b \leq H, 1 \leq c \leq d \leq W) such that:

For each cell (i,j) (1 \leq i \leq H, 1 \leq j \leq W),
if a \leq i \leq b and c \leq j \leq d, the cell is black;
otherwise, the cell is white.

Determine whether this is possible.

Input

The input is given from Standard Input in the following format:
H W
S_1
S_2
\vdots
S_H

Output

If it is possible to paint all the not-yet-painted cells so that the black cells form a rectangle, print Yes; otherwise, print No.

Constraints


- 1 \leq H, W \leq 1000
- H and W are integers.
- Each S_i is a string of length W consisting of #, ., ?.
- There is at least one cell that is already painted black.

Sample Input 1

3 5
.#?#.
.?#?.
?...?

Sample Output 1

Yes

The grid is in the following state. ? indicates a cell that are not yet painted.

By painting cells (1,3), (2,2), and (2,4) black and cells (3,1) and (3,5) white, the black cells can form a rectangle as follows:

Therefore, print Yes.

Sample Input 2

3 3
?##
#.#
##?

Sample Output 2

No

To form a rectangle with all black cells, you would need to paint cell (2,2) black, but it is already painted white.
Therefore, it is impossible to make all black cells form a rectangle, so print No.

Sample Input 3

1 1
#

Sample Output 3

Yes
