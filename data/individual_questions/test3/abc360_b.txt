Vertical Reading

--------------------
easy

QUESTION CONTENT:
--------------------
You are given two strings S and T consisting of lowercase English letters.
Determine if there exists a pair of integers c and w such that 1 \leq c \leq w < |S| and the following condition is satisfied. Here, |S| denotes the length of the string S. Note that w must be less than |S|.

- If S is split at every w characters from the beginning, the concatenation of the c-th characters of the substrings of length at least c in order equals T.

Input

The input is given from Standard Input in the following format:
S T

Output

Print Yes if there exists a pair of integers c and w such that 1 \leq c \leq w < |S| and the condition is satisfied, and No otherwise.

Constraints


- S and T are strings consisting of lowercase English letters.
- 1 \leq |T|  \leq  |S| \leq 100

Sample Input 1

atcoder toe

Sample Output 1

Yes

If S is split at every two characters, it looks like this:
at
co
de
r

Then, the concatenation of the 2nd characters of the substrings of length at least 2 is toe, which equals T. Thus, print Yes.

Sample Input 2

beginner r

Sample Output 2

No

w=|S| is not allowed, and no pair of integers 1 \leq c \leq w < |S| satisfies the condition. Thus, print No.

Sample Input 3

Sample Output 3

No
