QUESTION TITLE:
--------------------
Avoid K Partition

DIFFICULTY:
--------------------
hard

QUESTION CONTENT:
--------------------
You are given a sequence A = (A_1, A_2, \dots, A_N) of length N and an integer K.
There are 2^{N-1} ways to divide A into several contiguous subsequences. How many of these divisions have no subsequence whose elements sum to K? Find the count modulo 998244353.
Here, "to divide A into several contiguous subsequences" means the following procedure.

- Freely choose the number k (1 \leq k \leq N) of subsequences and an integer sequence (i_1, i_2, \dots, i_k, i_{k+1}) satisfying 1 = i_1 \lt i_2 \lt \dots \lt i_k \lt i_{k+1} = N+1.
- For each 1 \leq n \leq k, the n-th subsequence is formed by taking the i_n-th through (i_{n+1} - 1)-th elements of A, maintaining their order.

Here are some examples of divisions for A = (1, 2, 3, 4, 5):

- (1, 2, 3), (4), (5)
- (1, 2), (3, 4, 5)
- (1, 2, 3, 4, 5)
