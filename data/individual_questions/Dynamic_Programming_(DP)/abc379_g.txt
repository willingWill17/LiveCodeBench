DIFFICULTY:
--------------------
hard

QUESTION CONTENT:
--------------------
You are given a grid S with H rows and W columns consisting of 1, 2, 3, and ?. The character at the i-th row and j-th column is S_{i,j}.
By replacing each ? in S with 1, 2, or 3, we can obtain 3^q different grids, where q is the number of ?. Among these grids, how many satisfy the following condition? Print the count modulo 998244353.

- Any two adjacent (edge-sharing) cells contain different digits.

Input

The input is given from Standard Input in the following format:
H W
S_{1,1}S_{1,2}\ldots S_{1,W}
S_{2,1}S_{2,2}\ldots S_{2,W}
\vdots
S_{H,1}S_{H,2}\ldots S_{H,W}

Output

Print the answer.

Constraints


- 1 \leq H, W
- H \times W \leq 200
- H and W are integers.
- S is a grid with H rows and W columns consisting of 1, 2, 3, and ?.
