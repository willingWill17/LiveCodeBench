QUESTION CONTENT:
--------------------
You are playing a game.
There are N enemies lined up in a row, and the i-th enemy from the front has a health of H_i.
You will repeat the following action until the healths of all enemies become 0 or less, using a variable T initialized to 0.

- Increase T by 1. Then, attack the frontmost enemy with health 1 or more. If T is a multiple of 3, the enemy's health decreases by 3; otherwise, it decreases by 1.

Find the value of T when the healths of all enemies become 0 or less.

Input

The input is given from Standard Input in the following format:
N
H_1 H_2 \ldots H_N

Output

Print the answer.

Constraints


- 1 \leq N \leq 2\times 10^5
- 1 \leq H_i \leq 10^9
- All input values are integers.

Sample Input 1

3
6 2 2

Sample Output 1

8

The actions are performed as follows:

- T becomes 1. Attack the 1st enemy, and its health becomes 6-1=5.
- T becomes 2. Attack the 1st enemy, and its health becomes 5-1=4.
- T becomes 3. Attack the 1st enemy, and its health becomes 4-3=1.
- T becomes 4. Attack the 1st enemy, and its health becomes 1-1=0.
- T becomes 5. Attack the 2nd enemy, and its health becomes 2-1=1.
- T becomes 6. Attack the 2nd enemy, and its health becomes 1-3=-2.
- T becomes 7. Attack the 3rd enemy, and its health becomes 2-1=1.
- T becomes 8. Attack the 3rd enemy, and its health becomes 1-1=0.
