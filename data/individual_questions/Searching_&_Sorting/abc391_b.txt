QUESTION TITLE:

Seek Grid

DIFFICULTY:

easy

QUESTION CONTENT:
--------------------
You are given an N \times N grid S and an M \times M grid T. The cell at the i-th row from the top and the j-th column from the left is denoted by (i,j).
The colors of the cells in S and T are represented by N^2 characters S_{i,j} (1\leq i,j\leq N) and M^2 characters T_{i,j} (1\leq i,j\leq M), respectively. In grid S, cell (i,j) is white if S_{i,j} is ., and black if S_{i,j} is #. The same applies for grid T.
Find T within S. More precisely, output integers a and b (1 \leq a,b \leq N-M+1) that satisfy the following condition:

- S_{a+i-1,b+j-1} = T_{i,j} for every i,j (1\leq i,j \leq M).

Input

The input is given from Standard Input in the following format:
N M
S_{1,1}S_{1,2}\dots S_{1,N}
S_{2,1}S_{2,2}\dots S_{2,N}
\vdots
S_{N,1}S_{N,2}\dots S_{N,N}
T_{1,1}T_{1,2}\dots T_{1,M}
T_{2,1}T_{2,2}\dots T_{2,M}
\vdots
T_{M,1}T_{M,2}\dots T_{M,M}

Output

Print a and b in this order, separated by a space on one line.

Constraints


- 1 \leq M \leq N \leq 50
- N and M are integers.
- Each of S_{i,j} and T_{i,j} is . or #.
- There is exactly one pair (a,b) satisfying the condition.
