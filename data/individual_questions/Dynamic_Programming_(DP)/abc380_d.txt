QUESTION CONTENT:
--------------------
You are given a string S consisting of uppercase and lowercase English letters.  
We perform the following operation on S 10^{100} times:

- First, create a string T by changing uppercase letters in S to lowercase, and lowercase letters to uppercase.
- Then, concatenate S and T in this order to form a new S.

Answer Q queries. The i-th query is as follows:

- Find the K_i-th character from the beginning of S after all operations are completed.

Input

The input is given from Standard Input in the following format:
S
Q
K_1 K_2 \dots K_Q

Output

Let C_i be the answer to the i-th query. Print them in a single line, separated by spaces, in the following format:
C_1 C_2 \dots C_Q

Constraints


- S is a string consisting of uppercase and lowercase English letters, with length between 1 and 2 \times 10^5, inclusive.
- Q and K_i are integers.
- 1 \le Q \le 2 \times 10^5
- 1 \le K_i \le 10^{18}

Sample Input 1

aB
16
1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16

Sample Output 1

a B A b A b a B A b a B a B A b

Before the operations, S =  aB.

- After performing the operation once on aB, it becomes aBAb.
- After performing the operation twice on aB, it becomes aBAbAbaB.
- \dots

After performing the operation 10^{100} times, S =  aBAbAbaBAbaBaBAb...
