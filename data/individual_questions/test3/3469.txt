--------------------
maximum-height-of-a-triangle

DIFFICULTY:
--------------------
easy

QUESTION CONTENT:
--------------------
You are given two integers red and blue representing the count of red and blue colored balls. You have to arrange these balls to form a triangle such that the 1^st row will have 1 ball, the 2^nd row will have 2 balls, the 3^rd row will have 3 balls, and so on.
All the balls in a particular row should be the same color, and adjacent rows should have different colors.
Return the maximum height of the triangle that can be achieved.
 
Example 1:

Input: red = 2, blue = 4
Output: 3
Explanation:

The only possible arrangement is shown above.

Example 2:

Input: red = 2, blue = 1
