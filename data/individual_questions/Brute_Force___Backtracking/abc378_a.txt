QUESTION CONTENT:
--------------------
There are four balls, and the color of the i-th ball is A_i.
Find the maximum number of times you can perform this operation: choose two balls of the same color and discard both.

Input

The input is given from Standard Input in the following format:
A_1 A_2 A_3 A_4

Output

Print the maximum number of times the operation can be performed as an integer.

Constraints


- Each of A_1, A_2, A_3, A_4 is an integer between 1 and 4, inclusive.

Sample Input 1

2 1 2 1

Sample Output 1

2

The first and third balls both have color 2, so you can perform the operation to discard the first and third balls together.
Next, the second and fourth balls both have color 1, so you can perform the operation to discard the second and fourth balls together.
Hence, you can perform a total of two operations.

Sample Input 2

4 4 4 1

Sample Output 2

1

Sample Input 3

1 2 3 4

Sample Output 3

0

There are cases where you cannot perform the operation even once.
