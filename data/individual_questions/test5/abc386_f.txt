QUESTION CONTENT:
--------------------
This problem fully contains Problem C (Operate 1), with K \le 20.
You can solve Problem C by submitting a correct solution to this problem for Problem C.
Determine whether it is possible to perform the following operation on string S between 0 and K times, inclusive, to make it identical to string T.

- Choose one of the following three operations and execute it.
- Insert any one character at any position in S (possibly the beginning or end).
- Delete one character from S.
- Choose one character in S and replace it with another character.

Input

The input is given from Standard Input in the following format:
K
S
T

Output

If S can be made identical to T with at most K operations, print Yes; otherwise, print No.

Constraints


- Each of S and T is a string of length between 1 and 500000, inclusive, consisting of lowercase English letters.
- K is an integer satisfying \color{red}{1 \le K \le 20}.

Sample Input 1

3
abc
awtf

Sample Output 1

Yes

For example, here is a way to convert abc to awtf with three operations:

- Replace the second character b with w. After the operation, the string becomes awc.
- Replace the third character c with f. After the operation, the string becomes awf.
- Insert t between the second and third characters. After the operation, the string becomes awtf.
