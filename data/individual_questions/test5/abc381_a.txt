QUESTION TITLE:
--------------------
11/22 String

DIFFICULTY:
--------------------
easy

QUESTION CONTENT:
--------------------
The definition of an 11/22 string in this problem is the same as in Problems C and E.

A string T is called an 11/22 string when it satisfies all of the following conditions:

- |T| is odd. Here, |T| denotes the length of T.
- The 1-st through (\frac{|T|+1}{2} - 1)-th characters are all 1.
- The (\frac{|T|+1}{2})-th character is /.
- The (\frac{|T|+1}{2} + 1)-th through |T|-th characters are all 2.

For example, 11/22, 111/222, and / are 11/22 strings, but 1122, 1/22, 11/2222, 22/11, and //2/2/211 are not.
Given a string S of length N consisting of 1, 2, and /, determine whether S is an 11/22 string.

Input

The input is given from Standard Input in the following format:
N
S

Output

If S is an 11/22 string, print Yes; otherwise, print No.

Constraints


- 1 \leq N \leq 100
- S is a string of length N consisting of 1, 2, and /.

Sample Input 1

5

Sample Input 4

5
22/11

Sample Output 4

No
