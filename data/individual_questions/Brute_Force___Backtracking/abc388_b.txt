QUESTION TITLE:
--------------------
Heavy Snake

DIFFICULTY:
--------------------
easy

QUESTION CONTENT:
--------------------
There are N snakes.
Initially, the thickness of the i-th snake is T_i, and its length is L_i.
The weight of a snake is defined as the product of its thickness and length.
For each integer k satisfying 1 \leq k \leq D, find the weight of the heaviest snake when every snake's length has increased by k.

Input

The input is given from Standard Input in the following format:
N D
T_1 L_1
T_2 L_2
\vdots
T_N L_N

Output

Print D lines. The k-th line should contain the weight of the heaviest snake when every snake's length has increased by k.

Constraints


- 1 \leq N, D \leq 100
- 1 \leq T_i, L_i \leq 100
- All input values are integers.

Sample Input 1

4 3
3 3
5 1
2 4
1 10

Sample Output 1

12
15
20

When every snake’s length has increased by 1, the snakes' weights become 12, 10, 10, 11, so print 12 on the first line.
When every snake’s length has increased by 2, the snakes' weights become 15, 15, 12, 12, so print 15 on the second line.
When every snake’s length has increased by 3, the snakes' weights become 18, 20, 14, 13, so print 20 on the third line.

Sample Input 2

1 4
100 100

Sample Output 2

10100
10200
10300
10400
