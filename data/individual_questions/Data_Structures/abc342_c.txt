QUESTION CONTENT:
--------------------
You are given a string S of length N consisting of lowercase English letters.
You will perform an operation Q times on the string S.
The i-th operation (1\leq i\leq Q) is represented by a pair of characters (c _ i,d _ i), which corresponds to the following operation:

- Replace all occurrences of the character c _ i in S with the character d _ i.

Print the string S after all operations are completed.

Input

The input is given from Standard Input in the following format:
N
S
Q
c _ 1 d _ 1
c _ 2 d _ 2
\vdots
c _ Q d _ Q

Output

Print the string S after all operations are completed.

Constraints


- 1\leq N\leq2\times10^5
- S is a string of length N consisting of lowercase English letters.
- 1\leq Q\leq2\times10^5
- c _ i and d _ i are lowercase English letters (1\leq i\leq Q).
- N and Q are integers.

Sample Input 1

atcoder
4
r a
t e
d v
a r

Sample Output 1

recover

S changes as follows: atcoder → atcodea → aecodea → aecovea → recover.
For example, in the fourth operation, all occurrences of a in S={}aecovea (the first and seventh characters) are replaced with r, resulting in S={}recover.
After all operations are completed, S={}recover, so print recover.

Sample Input 2

3

4
a a
s k
n n
z b

Sample Output 2

abc

There may be operations where c _ i=d _ i or S does not contain c _ i.
