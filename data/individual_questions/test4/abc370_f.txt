QUESTION TITLE:
--------------------
Cake Division

DIFFICULTY:
--------------------
hard

QUESTION CONTENT:
--------------------
There is a circular cake divided into N pieces by cut lines. Each cut line is a line segment connecting the center of the circle to a point on the arc.
The pieces and cut lines are numbered 1, 2, \ldots, N in clockwise order, and piece i has a mass of A_i. Piece 1 is also called piece N + 1.
Cut line i is between pieces i and i + 1, and they are arranged clockwise in this order: piece 1, cut line 1, piece 2, cut line 2, \ldots, piece N, cut line N.
We want to divide this cake among K people under the following conditions. Let w_i be the sum of the masses of the pieces received by the i-th person.

- Each person receives one or more consecutive pieces.
- There are no pieces that no one receives.
- Under the above two conditions, \min(w_1, w_2, \ldots, w_K) is maximized.

Find the value of \min(w_1, w_2, \ldots, w_K) in a division that satisfies the conditions, and the number of cut lines that are never cut in the divisions that satisfy the conditions. Here, cut line i is considered cut if pieces i and i + 1 are given to different people.

Input

The input is given from Standard Input in the following format:
N K
A_1 A_2 \ldots A_N

Output

Let x be the value of \min(w_1, w_2, \ldots, w_K) in a division that satisfies the conditions, and y be the number of cut lines that are never cut. Print x and y in this order, separated by a space.

Constraints


- 2 \leq K \leq N \leq 2 \times 10^5
- 1 \leq A_i \leq 10^4
- All input values are integers.

Sample Input 1

5 2
3 6 8 6 4

Sample Output 1

13 1

The following divisions satisfy the conditions:

- Give pieces 2, 3 to one person and pieces 4, 5, 1 to the other. Pieces 2, 3 have a total mass of 14, and pieces 4, 5, 1 have a total mass of 13.
- Give pieces 3, 4 to one person and pieces 5, 1, 2 to the other. Pieces 3, 4 have a total mass of 14, and pieces 5, 1, 2 have a total mass of 13.

The value of \min(w_1, w_2) in divisions satisfying the conditions is 13, and there is one cut line that is not cut in either division: cut line 5.

Sample Input 2

6 3
4 7 11 3 9 2

Sample Output 2

11 1

Sample Input 3

10 3
2 9 8 1 7 9 1 3 5 8

Sample Output 3

17 4
