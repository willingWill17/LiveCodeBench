QUESTION TITLE:
--------------------
Zero Sum Game

DIFFICULTY:
--------------------
easy

QUESTION CONTENT:
--------------------
There are N people labeled 1 to N, who have played several one-on-one games without draws. Initially, each person started with 0 points. In each game, the winner's score increased by 1 and the loser's score decreased by 1 (scores can become negative). Determine the final score of person N if the final score of person i\ (1\leq i\leq N-1) is A_i. It can be shown that the final score of person N is uniquely determined regardless of the sequence of games.

Input

The input is given from Standard Input in the following format:
N
A_1 A_2 \ldots A_{N-1}

Output

Print the answer.

Constraints


- 2 \leq N \leq 100
- -100 \leq A_i \leq 100
- All input values are integers.

Sample Input 1

4
1 -2 -1

Sample Output 1

2

Here is one possible sequence of games where the final scores of persons 1, 2, 3 are 1, -2, -1, respectively.

- Initially, persons 1, 2, 3, 4 have 0, 0, 0, 0 points, respectively.
- Persons 1 and 2 play, and person 1 wins. The players now have 1, -1, 0, 0 point(s).
- Persons 1 and 4 play, and person 4 wins. The players now have 0, -1, 0, 1 point(s).
- Persons 1 and 2 play, and person 1 wins. The players now have 1, -2, 0, 1 point(s).
- Persons 2 and 3 play, and person 2 wins. The players now have 1, -1, -1, 1 point(s).
- Persons 2 and 4 play, and person 4 wins. The players now have 1, -2, -1, 2 point(s).

In this case, the final score of person 4 is 2. Other possible sequences of games exist, but the score of person 4 will always be 2 regardless of the progression.
