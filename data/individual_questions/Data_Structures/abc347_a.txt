QUESTION TITLE:
--------------------
Divisible

DIFFICULTY:
--------------------
easy

QUESTION CONTENT:
--------------------
You are given positive integers N and K, and a sequence of length N, A=(A_1,A_2,\ldots,A_N).
Extract all elements of A that are multiples of K, divide them by K, and print the quotients.

Input

The input is given from Standard Input in the following format:
N K
A_1 A_2 \ldots A_N

Output

Divide all elements of A that are multiples of K and print the quotients in ascending order with spaces in between.

Constraints


- 1\leq N,K\leq 100
- 1\leq A_1 < A_2 < \ldots < A_N \leq 100
- A has at least one multiple of K.
- All given numbers are integers.

Sample Input 1

5 2
2 5 6 7 10

Sample Output 1

1 3 5

The multiples of 2 among the elements in A are 2, 6, and 10. Divide them by 2 to get 1, 3, and 5, and print them in ascending order with spaces in between.

Sample Input 2

3 1
3 4 7

Sample Output 2

3 4 7

Sample Input 3

5 10
50 51 54 60 65

Sample Output 3

5 6
