QUESTION CONTENT:
--------------------
You are given a string S.
Find the maximum length of a contiguous substring of S that is a palindrome.
Note that there is always a contiguous substring of S that is a palindrome.

Input

The input is given from Standard Input in the following format:
S

Output

Print the answer.

Constraints


- S is a string of length between 2 and 100, inclusive, consisting of uppercase English letters.

Sample Input 1

TOYOTA

Sample Output 1

5

TOYOT, a contiguous substring of TOYOTA, is a palindrome of length 5.
TOYOTA, the only length-6 contiguous substring of TOYOTA, is not a palindrome, so print 5.

Sample Input 2

ABCDEFG

Sample Output 2

1

Every contiguous substring of length 1 is a palindrome.
