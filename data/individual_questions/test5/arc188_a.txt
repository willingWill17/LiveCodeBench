ABC Symmetry

QUESTION CONTENT:
--------------------
For a non-empty string T consisting of A, B, and C, we call it a good string if it can be turned into an empty string by performing the following two types of operations any number of times in any order.

- Operation 1: Choose two identical characters in the string and delete them (cannot be performed if there are not two or more identical characters).
- Operation 2: Choose one A, one B, and one C in the string and delete them (cannot be performed if there are not one or more of each of A, B, and C).

For example, ABACA is a good string because it can be turned into an empty string by performing the operations as follows:

- Choose the 2nd, 4th, and 5th characters and delete them (Operation 2). The string becomes AA.
- Choose the 1st and 2nd characters and delete them (Operation 1). The string becomes an empty string.

You are given a string S of length N consisting of A, B, C, and ?. How many ways are there to replace each ? with A, B, or C to form a string that contains at least K good strings as contiguous substrings? Substrings are counted separately if they are at different positions in the original string, even if they are identical strings.
Find the count modulo 998244353.

Input

The input is given from Standard Input in the following format:
N K
S

Output

Print the answer modulo 998244353.

Constraints


- 1 \leq N \leq 50
- 0 \leq K \leq \frac{N(N+1)}{2}
- N and K are integers.
- |S| = N
- S is a string consisting of A, B, C, and ?.

Sample Input 1

4 2
A?AB

Sample Output 1

1

By replacing ? with A, B, or C, we can obtain the following three strings: AAAB, ABAB, ACAB.
Among these, AAAB contains two good substrings: the AA at positions 1,2 and the AA at positions 2,3. Note that even if the substrings are identical as strings, they are counted separately if they are at different positions in the original string.
On the other hand, ABAB contains only one good substring ABAB. Also, ACAB contains only one good substring CAB.

Sample Input 2

50 411
??AB??C???????????????????????????????A???C????A??
