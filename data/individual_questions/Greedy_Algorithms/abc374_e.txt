Sensor Optimization Dilemma 2

DIFFICULTY:

hard

QUESTION CONTENT:
--------------------
The manufacturing of a certain product requires N processes numbered 1,2,\dots,N.
For each process i, there are two types of machines S_i and T_i available for purchase to handle it.

- Machine S_i: Can process A_i products per day per unit, and costs P_i yen per unit.
- Machine T_i: Can process B_i products per day per unit, and costs Q_i yen per unit.

You can purchase any number of each machine, possibly zero.
Suppose that process i can handle W_i products per day as a result of introducing machines.
Here, we define the production capacity as the minimum of W, that is, \displaystyle \min^{N}_{i=1} W_i.
Given a total budget of X yen, find the maximum achievable production capacity.

Input

The input is given from Standard Input in the following format:
N X
A_1 P_1 B_1 Q_1
A_2 P_2 B_2 Q_2
\vdots
A_N P_N B_N Q_N

Output

Print the answer as an integer.

Constraints


- All input values are integers.
- 1 \le N \le 100
- 1 \le A_i,B_i \le 100
- 1 \le P_i,Q_i,X \le 10^7

Sample Input 1

3 22
2 5 3 6
1 1 3 3
1 3 2 4

Sample Output 1

4

For example, by introducing machines as follows, we can achieve a production capacity of 4, which is the maximum possible.

- For process 1, introduce 2 units of machine S_1.
- This allows processing 4 products per day and costs a total of 10 yen.


- For process 2, introduce 1 unit of machine S_2.
- This allows processing 1 product per day and costs a total of 1 yen.


- For process 2, introduce 1 unit of machine T_2.
- This allows processing 3 products per day and costs a total of 3 yen.


- For process 3, introduce 2 units of machine T_3.
- This allows processing 4 products per day and costs a total of 8 yen.

Sample Input 2

1 10000000

Sample Output 2

1000000000

Sample Input 3

1 1
1 10000000 1 10000000

Sample Output 3

0

There may be cases where a positive production capacity cannot be achieved.
