QUESTION CONTENT:
--------------------
Takahashi has decided to give one gift to Aoki and one gift to Snuke.
There are N candidates of gifts for Aoki,
and their values are A_1, A_2, \ldots,A_N.
There are M candidates of gifts for Snuke,
and their values are B_1, B_2, \ldots,B_M.  
Takahashi wants to choose gifts so that the difference in values of the two gifts is at most D.
Determine if he can choose such a pair of gifts.  If he can, print the maximum sum of values of the chosen gifts.

Input

The input is given from Standard Input in the following format:
N M D
A_1 A_2 \ldots A_N
B_1 B_2 \ldots B_M

Output

If he can choose gifts to satisfy the condition,
print the maximum sum of values of the chosen gifts.
If he cannot satisfy the condition, print -1.

Constraints


- 1\leq N,M\leq 2\times 10^5
- 1\leq A_i,B_i\leq 10^{18}
- 0\leq D \leq 10^{18}
- All values in the input are integers.

Sample Input 1

2 3 2
3 10
2 5 15

Sample Output 1

8

The difference of values of the two gifts should be at most 2.
If he gives a gift with value 3 to Aoki and another with value 5 to Snuke, the condition is satisfied, achieving the maximum possible sum of values.
Thus, 3+5=8 should be printed.

Sample Input 2

3 3 0
1 3 3
6 2 7

Sample Output 2

-1

He cannot choose gifts to satisfy the condition.
Note that the candidates of gifts for a person may contain multiple gifts with the same value.

Sample Input 3

1 1 1000000000000000000
1000000000000000000
1000000000000000000

Sample Output 3

2000000000000000000

Note that the answer may not fit into a 32-bit integer type.

Sample Input 4

8 6 1
2 5 6 5 2 1 7 9
7 2 5 5 2 4

Sample Output 4

14
