The AtCoder railway line has N stations, numbered 1, 2, \ldots, N.
On this line, there are inbound trains that start at station 1 and stop at the stations 2, 3, \ldots, N in order, and outbound trains that start at station N and stop at the stations N - 1, N - 2, \ldots, 1 in order.
Takahashi is about to travel from station X to station Y using only one of the inbound and outbound trains.
Determine whether the train stops at station Z during this travel.
