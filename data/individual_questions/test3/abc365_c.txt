QUESTION TITLE:

Transportation Expenses

DIFFICULTY:

medium

QUESTION CONTENT:
--------------------
There are N people participating in an event, and the transportation cost for the i-th person is A_i yen.
Takahashi, the organizer of the event, decided to set a maximum limit x for the transportation subsidy. The subsidy for person i will be \min(x, A_i) yen. Here, x must be a non-negative integer.
Given that Takahashi's budget is M yen, and he wants the total transportation subsidy for all N people to be at most M yen, what is the maximum possible value of the subsidy limit x?
If the subsidy limit can be made infinitely large, report that instead.

Input

The input is given from Standard Input in the following format:
N M
A_1 A_2 \ldots A_{N}

Output

Print the maximum value of the subsidy limit x that satisfies the budget condition, as an integer.
If the subsidy limit can be made infinitely large, print infinite instead.

Constraints


- 1 \leq N \leq 2 \times 10^5
- 1 \leq M \leq 2 \times 10^{14}
- 1 \leq A_i \leq 10^9
- All input values are integers.

Sample Input 1

4 8
1 3 2 4

Sample Output 1

2

If the subsidy limit is set to 2 yen, the total transportation subsidy for all N people is \min(2,1) + \min(2,3) + \min(2,2) + \min(2,4) = 7 yen, which is within the budget of 8 yen.
If the subsidy limit is set to 3 yen, the total transportation subsidy for all N people is \min(3,1) + \min(3,3) + \min(3,2) + \min(3,4) = 9 yen, which exceeds the budget of 8 yen.
Therefore, the maximum possible value of the subsidy limit is 2 yen.

Sample Input 2

3 20
5 3 2

Sample Output 2

infinite

The subsidy limit can be made infinitely large.
