In the Kingdom of AtCoder, residents are required to shout their love for takoyaki at A o'clock every day.
Takahashi, who lives in the Kingdom of AtCoder, goes to bed at B o'clock and wakes up at C o'clock every day (in the 24-hour clock). He can shout his love for takoyaki when he is awake, but cannot when he is asleep. Determine whether he can shout his love for takoyaki every day. Here, a day has 24 hours, and his sleeping time is less than 24 hours.
