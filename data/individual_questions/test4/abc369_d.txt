QUESTION CONTENT:
--------------------
Takahashi will encounter N monsters in order. The i-th monster (1\leq i\leq N) has a strength of A_i.
For each monster, he can choose to either let it go or defeat it.
Each action awards him experience points as follows:

- If he lets a monster go, he gains 0 experience points.
- If he defeats a monster with strength X, he gains X experience points.
  If it is an even-numbered defeated monster (2nd, 4th, ...), he gains an additional X experience points.

Find the maximum total experience points he can gain from the N monsters.

Input

The input is given from Standard Input in the following format:
N
A_1 A_2 \ldots A_N

Output

Print the maximum total experience points he can gain from the N monsters as an integer.

Constraints


- 1\leq N\leq 2\times 10^5
- 1\leq A_i\leq 10^9
- All input values are integers.

Sample Input 1

5
1 5 3 2 7

Sample Output 1

28

If Takahashi defeats the 1st, 2nd, 3rd, and 5th monsters, and lets the 4th monster go, he gains experience points as follows:

- Defeats a monster with strength A_1=1. He gains 1 experience point.
- Defeats a monster with strength A_2=5. He gains 5 experience points. As it is the 2nd defeated monster, he gains an additional 5 points.
- Defeats a monster with strength A_3=3. He gains 3 experience points.
- Lets the 4th monster go. Takahashi gains no experience points.
- Defeats a monster with strength A_5=7. He gains 7 experience points. As it is the 4th defeated monster, he gains an additional 7 points.

Therefore, in this case, he gains 1+(5+5)+3+0+(7+7)=28 experience points.
Note that even if he encounters a monster, if he lets it go, it does not count as defeated.
He can gain at most 28 experience points no matter how he acts, so print 28.
As a side note, if he defeats all monsters in this case, he would gain 1+(5+5)+3+(2+2)+7=25 experience points.

Sample Input 2

2
1000000000 1000000000

Sample Output 2

3000000000

Beware that the answer may not fit in a 32-bit integer.
