QUESTION TITLE:
--------------------
Typing

DIFFICULTY:

easy

QUESTION CONTENT:
--------------------
Takahashi tried to type a string S consisting of lowercase English letters using a keyboard.
He was typing while looking only at the keyboard, not the screen.
Whenever he mistakenly typed a different lowercase English letter, he immediately pressed the backspace key. However, the backspace key was broken, so the mistakenly typed letter was not deleted, and the actual string typed was T.
He did not mistakenly press any keys other than those for lowercase English letters.
The characters in T that were not mistakenly typed are called correctly typed characters.
Determine the positions in T of the correctly typed characters.

Input

The input is given from Standard Input in the following format:
S
T

Output

Let |S| be the length of S. If the correctly typed characters are the A_1-th, A_2-th, \ldots, A_{|S|}-th characters of T, print the values of A_1, A_2, \ldots, A_{|S|} in this order, separated by spaces.
Ensure that the output is in ascending order. That is, A_i < A_{i + 1} should hold for each 1 \leq i \leq |S| - 1.

Constraints


- S and T are strings of lowercase English letters with lengths between 1 and 2 \times 10^5, inclusive.
- T is a string obtained by the procedure described in the problem statement.

Sample Input 1

abc
axbxyc

Sample Output 1

1 3 6

The sequence of Takahashi's typing is as follows:

- Type a.
- Try to type b but mistakenly type x.
- Press the backspace key, but the character is not deleted.
- Type b.
- Try to type c but mistakenly type x.
- Press the backspace key, but the character is not deleted.
- Try to type c but mistakenly type y.
- Press the backspace key, but the character is not deleted.
- Type c.

The correctly typed characters are the first, third, and sixth characters.

Sample Input 2

aaaa
bbbbaaaa

Sample Output 2

5 6 7 8

Sample Input 3

atcoder
atcoder

Sample Output 3

1 2 3 4 5 6 7

Takahashi did not mistakenly type any characters.
