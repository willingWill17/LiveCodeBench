Many LCS

DIFFICULTY:
--------------------
hard

QUESTION CONTENT:
--------------------
You are given a lowercase English string S of length N and an integer M. For each k=0,1,\ldots,N, solve the following problem:

- There are 26^M lowercase English strings of length M. Among these, find the number, modulo 998244353, of strings whose longest common subsequence with S has length exactly k.

Input

The input is given from Standard Input in the following format:
N M
S

Output

Let \mathrm{ans}_i be the answer for k=i. Print the answers in the following format:
\mathrm{ans}_0 \mathrm{ans}_1 \ldots \mathrm{ans}_N

Constraints


- 1\leq N\leq 10
- 1\leq M\leq 100
- N and M are integers.
- S is a lowercase English string of length N.

Sample Input 1

2 2
ab

Sample Output 1

576 99 1

The answers for k=0,1,2 are as follows:

- For k=0: Among length 2 lowercase English strings, those with a longest common subsequence of length 0 with ab include strings such as cd, re, zz, totaling 576.
- For k=1: Among length 2 lowercase English strings, those with a longest common subsequence of length 1 with ab include strings such as ac, wa, ba, totaling 99.
- For k=2: Among length 2 lowercase English strings, there is 1 string (ab) whose longest common subsequence with ab has length 2.
