QUESTION CONTENT:
--------------------
KEYENCE is famous for quick delivery.

In this problem, the calendar proceeds as Day 1, Day 2, Day 3, \dots.
There are orders 1,2,\dots,N, and it is known that order i will be placed on Day T_i.
For these orders, shipping is carried out according to the following rules.

- At most K orders can be shipped together.
- Order i can only be shipped on Day T_i or later.
- Once a shipment is made, the next shipment cannot be made until X days later.
- That is, if a shipment is made on Day a, the next shipment can be made on Day a+X.



For each day that passes from order placement to shipping, dissatisfaction accumulates by 1 per day.
That is, if order i is shipped on Day S_i, the dissatisfaction accumulated for that order is (S_i - T_i).
Find the minimum possible total dissatisfaction accumulated over all orders when you optimally schedule the shipping dates.

Input

The input is given from Standard Input in the following format:
N K X
T_1 T_2 \dots T_N

Output

Print the answer as an integer.

Constraints


- All input values are integers.
- 1 \le K \le N \le 100
- 1 \le X \le 10^9
- 1 \le T_1 \le T_2 \le \dots \le T_N \le 10^{12}

Sample Input 1

5 2 3
1 5 6 10 12

Sample Output 1

2

For example, by scheduling shipments as follows, we can achieve a total dissatisfaction of 2, which is the minimum possible.

- Ship order 1 on Day 1.
- This results in dissatisfaction of (1-1) = 0, and the next shipment can be made on Day 4.


- Ship orders 2 and 3 on Day 6.
- This results in dissatisfaction of (6-5) + (6-6) = 1, and the next shipment can be made on Day 9.


- Ship order 4 on Day 10.
- This results in dissatisfaction of (10-10) = 0, and the next shipment can be made on Day 13.


- Ship order 5 on Day 13.
- This results in dissatisfaction of (13-12) = 1, and the next shipment can be made on Day 16.
