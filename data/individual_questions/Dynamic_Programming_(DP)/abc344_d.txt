--------------------
String Bags

DIFFICULTY:
--------------------
hard

QUESTION CONTENT:
--------------------
You initially have an empty string S.
Additionally, there are bags 1, 2, \dots, N, each containing some strings.
Bag i contains A_i strings S_{i,1}, S_{i,2}, \dots, S_{i,A_i}.
You will repeat the following steps for i = 1, 2, \dots, N:

- Choose and perform one of the following two actions:
- Pay 1 yen, select exactly one string from bag i, and concatenate it to the end of S.
- Do nothing.



Given a string T, find the minimum amount of money required to make the final S equal T.
If there is no way to make the final S equal T, print -1.

Input

The input is given from Standard Input in the following format:
T
N
A_1 S_{1,1} S_{1,2} \dots S_{1,A_1}
A_2 S_{2,1} S_{2,2} \dots S_{2,A_2}
\vdots
A_N S_{N,1} S_{N,2} \dots S_{N,A_N}

Output

Print the answer as an integer.

Constraints


- T is a string consisting of lowercase English letters with length between 1 and 100, inclusive.
- N is an integer between 1 and 100, inclusive.
- A_i is an integer between 1 and 10, inclusive.
- S_{i,j} is a string consisting of lowercase English letters with length between 1 and 10, inclusive.

Sample Input 1

abcde
3
3 ab abc abcd
4 f c cd bcde
2 e de

Sample Output 1

2

For example, doing the following makes the final S equal T with two yen, which can be shown to be the minimum amount required.

- For i=1, select abc from bag 1 and concatenate it to the end of S, making S= abc.
- For i=2, do nothing.
- For i=3, select de from bag 3 and concatenate it to the end of S, making S= abcde.

Sample Input 2

abcde
3
2 ab abc
3 f c bcde
1 e

Sample Output 2

-1

There is no way to make the final S equal T, so print -1.

Sample Input 3

aaabbbbcccc
6
2 aa aaa
2 dd ddd
2 ab aabb
4 bbaa bbbc bbb bbcc
2 cc bcc
3 ccc cccc ccccc

Sample Output 3

4
