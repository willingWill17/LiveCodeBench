smallest-divisible-digit-product-i

DIFFICULTY:
--------------------
easy

QUESTION CONTENT:
--------------------
You are given two integers n and t. Return the smallest number greater than or equal to n such that the product of its digits is divisible by t.
 
Example 1:

Input: n = 10, t = 2
Output: 10
Explanation:
The digit product of 10 is 0, which is divisible by 2, making it the smallest number greater than or equal to 10 that satisfies the condition.

Example 2:

Input: n = 15, t = 3
Output: 16
Explanation:
The digit product of 16 is 6, which is divisible by 3, making it the smallest number greater than or equal to 15 that satisfies the condition.

 
Constraints:

1 <= n <= 100
1 <= t <= 10
