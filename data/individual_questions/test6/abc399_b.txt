QUESTION TITLE:
--------------------
Ranking with Ties

DIFFICULTY:
--------------------
easy

QUESTION CONTENT:
--------------------
N people labeled from 1 to N participated in a certain contest. The score of person i (1 \leq i \leq N) was P_i.
In this contest, the rank of each of the N people is determined by the following procedure:

- Prepare a variable r, and initialize r = 1. Initially, the ranks of the N people are all undetermined.
- Repeat the following operation until the ranks of all N people are determined:
- Let x be the maximum score among the people whose ranks are currently undetermined, and let k be the number of people whose score is x. Determine the rank of those k people with score x to be r, and then add k to r.



Print the rank of each of the N people.

Input

The input is given from Standard Input in the following format:
N
P_1 P_2 \dots P_N

Output

Print N lines. The i-th line (1 \leq i \leq N) should contain the rank of person i as an integer.

Constraints


- 1\leq N \leq 100
- 1\leq P_i \leq 100
- All input values are integers.

The ranks of the N\ (=4) people are determined as follows:

- Prepare a variable r and initialize r=1. At first, the ranks of all 4 people are undetermined.
- Currently, persons 1, 2, 3, 4 have undetermined ranks. The maximum score among them is P_2\ (=12). Therefore, determine the rank of person 2 to be r\ (=1), and then add 1 to r, making r=2.
- Currently, persons 1, 3, 4 have undetermined ranks. The maximum score among them is P_3=P_4\ (=9). Therefore, determine the ranks of persons 3 and 4 to be r\ (=2), and then add 2 to r, making r=4.
- Currently, person 1 has an undetermined rank. The maximum score among them is P_1\ (=3). Therefore, determine the rank of person 1 to be r\ (=4), and then add 1 to r, making r=5.
- The ranks of all 4 people are now determined, so the process ends.
