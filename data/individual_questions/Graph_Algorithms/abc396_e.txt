QUESTION TITLE:
--------------------
Min of Restricted Sum

DIFFICULTY:
--------------------
hard

QUESTION CONTENT:
--------------------
You are given integers N, M and three integer sequences of length M: X = (X_1, X_2, \ldots, X_M), Y = (Y_1, Y_2, \ldots, Y_M), and Z = (Z_1, Z_2, \ldots, Z_M). It is guaranteed that all elements of X and Y are between 1 and N, inclusive.
We call a length-N sequence of non-negative integers A = (A_1, A_2, \ldots, A_N) a good sequence if and only if it satisfies the following condition:

- For every integer i with 1 \le i \le M, the XOR of A_{X_i} and A_{Y_i} is Z_i.

Determine whether a good sequence A=(A_1,A_2,\ldots,A_N) exists, and if it exists, find one good sequence that minimizes the sum of its elements \displaystyle \sum_{i=1}^N A_i.

Notes on XOR

For non-negative integers A and B, their XOR A \oplus B is defined as follows:


- In the binary representation of A \oplus B, the digit in the place corresponding to 2^k \,(k \ge 0) is 1 if and only if exactly one of the digits in the same place of A and B is 1; otherwise, it is 0.


For example, 3 \oplus 5 = 6 (in binary: 011 \oplus 101 = 110).

Input

The input is given from Standard Input in the following format:
N M
X_1 Y_1 Z_1
X_2 Y_2 Z_2
\vdots
X_M Y_M Z_M

Output

If no good sequence exists, print -1.
If a good sequence exists, print one good sequence that minimizes the sum of its elements, separated by spaces.
If there are multiple good sequences with the same minimum sum, printing any of them is accepted.

Constraints


- 1 \le N \le 2\times 10^5
- 0 \le M \le 10^5
- 1 \le X_i, Y_i \le N
- 0 \le Z_i \le 10^9
- All input values are integers.

Sample Input 1

3 2
1 3 4
1 2 3

Sample Output 1

0 3 4

A=(0,3,4) is a good sequence because A_1 \oplus A_2 = 3 and A_1 \oplus A_3 = 4.
Other good sequences include A=(1,2,5) and A=(7,4,3), but A=(0,3,4) has the smallest sum among all good sequences.

Sample Input 2

3 3
1 3 4
1 2 3
2 3 5

Sample Output 2

-1

No good sequence exists, so print -1.

Sample Input 3

5 8
4 2 4
2 3 11
3 4 15
4 5 6
3 2 11
3 3 0
3 1 9
3 4 15

Sample Output 3

0 2 9 6 0
