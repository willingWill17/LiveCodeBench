QUESTION CONTENT:
--------------------
For two N \times N matrices A and B whose elements are 0 or 1, we say that A and B are similar if they satisfy the following conditions:

- The sums of corresponding rows are equal. That is, A_{i,1} + \dots + A_{i,N} = B_{i,1} + \dots + B_{i,N} for any i=1,\dots,N.
- The sums of corresponding columns are equal. That is, A_{1,j} + \dots + A_{N,j} = B_{1,j} + \dots + B_{N,j} for any j=1,\dots,N.

Furthermore, for an N \times N matrix A whose elements are 0 or 1, and integers i,j (1 \leq i,j \leq N), we say that the element at row i column j is fixed if A_{i,j} = B_{i,j} holds for any matrix B that is similar to A.
Answer the following Q queries:

- The i-th query: If there exists an N \times N matrix whose elements are 0 or 1 such that exactly K_i elements are fixed, output Yes; otherwise, output No.

Input

The input is given from Standard Input in the following format:
N Q
K_1
K_2
\vdots
K_Q

Output

Output Q lines.
For the i-th line (1 \le i \le Q), output the answer for the i-th query.

Constraints


- 2 \le N \le 30
- 1 \le Q \le N^2+1
- 0 \le K_i \le N^2
- K_i \ne K_j (1 \le i < j \le Q)
- All inputs are integers

Sample Input 1

3 3
0
9
7

Sample Output 1

Yes
Yes
No

Query 1:
For example, the following matrix X has exactly 0 fixed elements.
1 0 0
0 1 0
0 0 1

This is because all the following matrices, obtained by cyclically shifting the columns, are similar to X, and each element can be either 0 or 1.
0 0 1
1 0 0
0 1 0

0 1 0
0 0 1
1 0 0

Query 2:
For example, the following matrix X has exactly 9 fixed elements.
0 0 1
0 1 1
1 1 1

This is because no other matrix similar to X exists, and all elements are fixed.
Query 3:
No matrix exists with exactly 7 fixed elements.

Sample Input 2
