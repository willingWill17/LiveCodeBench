QUESTION TITLE:
--------------------
Sanitize Hands

DIFFICULTY:
--------------------
easy

QUESTION CONTENT:
--------------------
There is a bottle of disinfectant that can disinfect exactly M hands.
N aliens come one by one to disinfect their hands.
The i-th alien (1 \leq i \leq N) has H_i hands and wants to disinfect all of their hands once.
Determine how many aliens can disinfect all of their hands.
Here, even if there is not enough disinfectant left for an alien to disinfect all of their hands when they start, they will use up the remaining disinfectant.

Input

The input is given from Standard Input in the following format:
N M
H_1 H_2 \ldots H_N

Output

Print the number of aliens who can disinfect all of their hands.

Constraints


- 1 \leq N, M \leq 100
- 1 \leq H_i \leq 100
- All input values are integers.

Sample Input 1

5 10
2 3 2 5 3

Sample Output 1

3

The aliens disinfect their hands in the following steps:

- The first alien disinfects their two hands. The remaining disinfectant can disinfect 10-2=8 hands.
- The second alien disinfects their three hands. The remaining disinfectant can disinfect 8-3=5 hands.
- The third alien disinfects their two hands. The remaining disinfectant can disinfect 5-2=3 hands.
- The fourth alien has five hands, but there is only enough disinfectant for three hands, so they use up the disinfectant without disinfecting all of their hands.

Thus, the first three aliens can disinfect all of their hands, so print 3.

Sample Input 2

5 10
2 3 2 3 5

Sample Output 2

4

Sample Input 3

1 5
1

Sample Output 3

1

All aliens can disinfect their hands.
