Variety Split Hard

QUESTION CONTENT:
--------------------
This problem is a harder version of Problem C. Here, the sequence is split into three subarrays.

You are given an integer sequence of length N: A = (A_1, A_2, \ldots, A_N).
When splitting A at two positions into three non-empty (contiguous) subarrays, find the maximum possible sum of the counts of distinct integers in those subarrays.
More formally, find the maximum sum of the following three values for a pair of integers (i,j) such that 1 \leq i < j \leq N-1: the count of distinct integers in (A_1, A_2, \ldots, A_i), the count of distinct integers in (A_{i+1},A_{i+2},\ldots,A_j), and the count of distinct integers in (A_{j+1},A_{j+2},\ldots,A_{N}).

Input

The input is given from Standard Input in the following format:
N
A_1 A_2 \ldots A_N

Output

Print the answer.

Constraints


- 3 \leq N \leq 3 \times 10^5
- 1 \leq A_i \leq N (1 \leq i \leq N)
- All input values are integers.

Sample Input 1

5
3 1 4 1 5

Sample Output 1

5

If we let (i,j) = (2,4) to split the sequence into three subarrays (3,1), (4,1), (5), the counts of distinct integers in those subarrays are 2, 2, 1, respectively, for a total of 5. This sum cannot be greater than 5, so the answer is 5. Other partitions, such as (i,j) = (1,3), (2,3), (3,4), also achieve this sum.

Sample Input 2

10
2 5 6 4 4 1 1 3 1 4

Sample Output 2

9
