QUESTION TITLE:
--------------------
Diagonal Separation

DIFFICULTY:
--------------------
hard

QUESTION CONTENT:
--------------------
There is an N \times N grid. Takahashi wants to color each cell black or white so that all of the following conditions are satisfied:

- For every row, the following condition holds:

- There exists an integer i\ (0\leq i\leq N) such that the leftmost i cells are colored black, and the rest are colored white.

- For every column, the following condition holds:

- There exists an integer i\ (0\leq i\leq N) such that the topmost i cells are colored black, and the rest are colored white.


Out of these N^2 cells, M of them have already been colored. Among them, the i-th one is at the X_i-th row from the top and the Y_i-th column from the left, and it is colored black if C_i is B and white if C_i is W.
Determine whether he can color the remaining uncolored N^2 - M cells so that all the conditions are satisfied.

Input

The input is given from Standard Input in the following format:
N M
X_1 Y_1 C_1
\vdots
X_M Y_M C_M

Output

If it is possible to satisfy the conditions, print Yes; otherwise, print No.

Constraints


- 1\leq N\leq 10^9
- 1\leq M\leq \min(N^2,2\times 10^5)
- 1\leq X_i,Y_i\leq N
- (X_i,Y_i)\neq (X_j,Y_j)\ (i\neq j)
- C_i is B or W.
- All input numbers are integers.

Sample Input 1

4 3
4 1 B
3 2 W
1 3 B

Sample Output 1

Yes

For example, one can color the grid as in the following figure to satisfy the conditions. The cells already colored are surrounded by red borders.

Sample Input 2

2 2
1 2 W
2 2 B

Sample Output 2

No

No matter how the remaining two cells are colored, the conditions cannot be satisfied.

Sample Input 3

1 1
1 1 W

Sample Output 3

Yes

Sample Input 4

2289 10
1700 1083 W
528 967 B
1789 211 W
518 1708 W
1036 779 B
136 657 B
759 1497 B
902 1309 B
1814 712 B
936 763 B

Sample Output 4

No
