Square Price

DIFFICULTY:
--------------------
hard

QUESTION CONTENT:
--------------------
There are N types of products, each having 10^{100} units in stock.
You can buy any non-negative number of units of each product. To buy k units of the i-th product, it costs k^2 P_i yen.
If your total purchase cost is at most M yen, what is the maximum number of units you can buy in total?

Input

The input is given from Standard Input in the following format:
N M
P_1 \ldots P_N

Output

Print the answer.

Constraints


- 1 \leq N \leq 2 \times 10^{5}
- 1 \leq M \leq 10^{18}
- 1 \leq P_i \leq 2 \times 10^{9}
- All input values are integers.

Sample Input 1

3 9
4 1 9

Sample Output 1

3

If you buy one unit of the 1st product and two units of the 2nd product, the total purchase cost is 1^2 \times 4 + 2^2 \times 1 = 8. It is impossible to buy four or more units in total with a total cost of at most 9 yen, so the answer is 3.

Sample Input 2

10 1000
2 15 6 5 12 1 7 9 17 2

Sample Output 2

53
