QUESTION TITLE:
--------------------
Decrease 2 max elements

DIFFICULTY:
--------------------
easy

QUESTION CONTENT:
--------------------
You are given a sequence of N positive integers A = (A_1, A_2, \dots ,A_N). Takahashi repeats the following operation until A contains one or fewer positive elements:

- Sort A in descending order. Then, decrease both A_1 and A_2 by 1.

Find the number of times he performs this operation.

Input

The input is given from Standard Input in the following format:
N
A_1 A_2 \cdots A_N

Output

Print the answer.

Constraints


- 2 \leq N \leq 100
- 1 \leq A_i \leq 100
- All input values are integers.

Sample Input 1

4
1 2 3 3

Sample Output 1

4

The process goes as follows:

- After the 1st operation, A is (2, 2, 2, 1).
- After the 2nd operation, A is (1, 1, 2, 1).
- After the 3rd operation, A is (1, 0, 1, 1).
- After the 4th operation, A is (0, 0, 1, 0). A no longer contains more than one positive elements, so the process ends here.

Sample Input 2

3
1 1 100

Sample Output 2

2
