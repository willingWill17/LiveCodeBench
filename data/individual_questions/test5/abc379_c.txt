QUESTION TITLE:

Sowing Stones

DIFFICULTY:

medium

QUESTION CONTENT:
--------------------
There are N cells numbered from 1 to N in a row. Initially, M cells contain stones, and cell X_i contains A_i stones (1 \leq i \leq M).
You can perform the following operation any number of times (possibly zero):

- If cell i (1 \leq i \leq N-1) contains a stone, move one stone from cell i to cell i+1.

Find the minimum number of operations required to reach a state where each of the N cells contains exactly one stone. If it is impossible, print -1.

Input

The input is given from Standard Input in the following format:
N M
X_1 X_2 \ldots X_M
A_1 A_2 \ldots A_M

Output

Print the answer.

Constraints


- 2 \leq N \leq 2 \times 10^{9}
- 1 \leq M \leq 2 \times 10^{5}
- M \leq N
- 1 \leq X_i \leq N (1 \leq i \leq M)
- X_i \neq X_j (1 \leq i < j \leq M)
- 1 \leq A_i \leq 2 \times 10^{9} (1 \leq i \leq M)
- All input values are integers.

Sample Input 1

5 2
1 4
3 2

Sample Output 1

4

You can reach a state where each of the five cells contains exactly one stone with four operations as follows:

- Move one stone from cell 1 to cell 2.
- Move one stone from cell 2 to cell 3.
- Move one stone from cell 4 to cell 5.
- Move one stone from cell 1 to cell 2.

It is impossible to achieve the goal in three or fewer operations. Therefore, print 4.

Sample Input 2

10 3
1 4 8
4 2 4

Sample Output 2

-1

No matter how you perform the operations, you cannot reach a state where all ten cells contain exactly one stone. Therefore, print -1.
