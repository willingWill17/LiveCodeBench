QUESTION CONTENT:
--------------------
There is a grid of N^2 squares with N rows and N columns.
Let (i,j) denote the square at the i-th row from the top (1\leq i\leq N) and j-th column from the left (1\leq j\leq N).
Each square is either empty or has a piece placed on it.
There are M pieces placed on the grid, and the k-th (1\leq k\leq M) piece is placed on square (a_k,b_k).
You want to place your piece on an empty square in such a way that it cannot be captured by any of the existing pieces.
A piece placed on square (i,j) can capture pieces that satisfy any of the following conditions:

- Placed on square (i+2,j+1)
- Placed on square (i+1,j+2)
- Placed on square (i-1,j+2)
- Placed on square (i-2,j+1)
- Placed on square (i-2,j-1)
- Placed on square (i-1,j-2)
- Placed on square (i+1,j-2)
- Placed on square (i+2,j-1)

Here, conditions involving non-existent squares are considered to never be satisfied.
For example, a piece placed on square (4,4) can capture pieces placed on the squares shown in blue in the following figure:

How many squares can you place your piece on?

Input

The input is given from Standard Input in the following format:
N M
a_1 b_1
a_2 b_2
\vdots
a_M b_M

Output

Print the number of empty squares where you can place your piece without it being captured by any existing pieces.

Constraints


- 1\leq N\leq10^9
- 1\leq M\leq2\times10^5
- 1\leq a_k\leq N,1\leq b_k\leq N\ (1\leq k\leq M)
- (a_k,b_k)\neq(a_l,b_l)\ (1\leq k\lt l\leq M)
- All input values are integers.

Sample Input 1

8 6
1 4
2 1
3 8
4 5
5 2
8 3

Sample Output 1

38

The existing pieces can capture pieces placed on the squares shown in blue in the following figure:

Therefore, you can place your piece on the remaining 38 squares.

Sample Input 2

1000000000 1
1 1

Sample Output 2

999999999999999997

Out of 10^{18} squares, only 3 squares cannot be used: squares (1,1), (2,3), and (3,2).
Note that the answer may be 2^{32} or greater.

Sample Input 3

20 10
1 4
7 11
7 15
8 10
11 6
12 5
13 1
15 2
20 10
20 15

Sample Output 3

338
