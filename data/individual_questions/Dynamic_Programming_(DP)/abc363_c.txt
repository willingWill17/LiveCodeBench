QUESTION TITLE:
--------------------
Avoid K Palindrome 2

DIFFICULTY:
--------------------
medium

QUESTION CONTENT:
--------------------
You are given a string S of length N consisting only of lowercase English letters.
Find the number of strings obtained by permuting the characters of S (including the string S itself) that do not contain a palindrome of length K as a substring.
Here, a string T of length N is said to "contain a palindrome of length K as a substring" if and only if there exists a non-negative integer i not greater than (N-K) such that T_{i+j} = T_{i+K+1-j} for every integer j with 1 \leq j \leq K.
Here, T_k denotes the k-th character of the string T.

Input

The input is given from Standard Input in the following format:
N K
S

Output

Print the number of strings obtained by permuting S that do not contain a palindrome of length K as a substring.

Constraints


- 2 \leq K \leq N \leq 10
- N and K are integers.
- S is a string of length N consisting only of lowercase English letters.

Sample Input 1

3 2
aab

Sample Output 1

1

The strings obtained by permuting aab are aab, aba, and baa. Among these, aab and baa contain the palindrome aa of length 2 as a substring.
Thus, the only string that satisfies the condition is aba, so print 1.

Sample Input 2

5 3
zzyyx

Sample Output 2

16

There are 30 strings obtained by permuting zzyyx, 16 of which do not contain a palindrome of length 3. Thus, print 16.

Sample Input 3

10 5
abcwxyzyxw

Sample Output 3

440640
