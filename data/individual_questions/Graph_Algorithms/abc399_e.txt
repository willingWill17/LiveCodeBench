QUESTION TITLE:
--------------------
Replace

DIFFICULTY:
--------------------
hard

QUESTION CONTENT:
--------------------
You are given a positive integer N and two strings S and T, each of length N and consisting of lowercase English letters.
Determine whether it is possible to make S identical to T by repeating the operation below any number of times (possibly zero). If it is possible, also find the minimum number of operations required.

- Choose two lowercase English letters x, y and replace every occurrence of x in S with y.

Input

The input is given from Standard Input in the following format:
N
S
T

Output

If it is possible to make S identical to T, print the minimum number of operations required. Otherwise, print -1.

Constraints


- 1\leq N \leq 2\times 10^5
- N is an integer.
- Each of S and T is a string of length N, consisting of lowercase English letters.

Sample Input 1

6
afbfda
bkckbb

Sample Output 1

4

By performing the operation four times in the following way, you can make S identical to T:

- Choose x= b and y= c. S becomes afcfda.
- Choose x= a and y= b. S becomes bfcfdb.
- Choose x= f and y= k. S becomes bkckdb.
- Choose x= d and y= b. S becomes bkckbb, which is identical to T.

It cannot be done with fewer than four operations, so the minimum number of operations required is 4.

Sample Input 2

4
abac
abac

Sample Output 2

0

S and T are already identical, so no operations are required.

Sample Input 3

4
abac
abrc

Sample Output 3

-1

No matter how you repeat the operation, it is impossible to make S identical to T.

Sample Input 4

4
abac
bcba

Sample Output 4

4
