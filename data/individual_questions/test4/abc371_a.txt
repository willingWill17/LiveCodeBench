QUESTION CONTENT:
--------------------
There are three brothers named A, B, and C. The age relationships among them are given by three characters S_{\mathrm{AB}}, S_{\mathrm{AC}}, S_{\mathrm{BC}}, which mean the following:

- If S_{\mathrm{AB}} is <, then A is younger than B; if it is >, then A is older than B.
- If S_{\mathrm{AC}} is <, then A is younger than C; if it is >, then A is older than C.
- If S_{\mathrm{BC}} is <, then B is younger than C; if it is >, then B is older than C.

Who is the middle brother, that is, the second oldest among the three?

Input

The input is given from Standard Input in the following format:
S_{\mathrm{AB}} S_{\mathrm{AC}} S_{\mathrm{BC}}

Output

Print the name of the middle brother, that is, the second oldest among the three.

Constraints


- Each of S_{\mathrm{AB}}, S_{\mathrm{AC}}, S_{\mathrm{BC}} is < or >.
- The input contains no contradictions; that is, there always exists an age relationship that satisfies all given inequalities.

Sample Input 1

< < <

Sample Output 1

B

Since A is younger than B, and B is younger than C, we can determine that C is the oldest, B is the middle, and A is the youngest. Hence, the answer is B.

Sample Input 2

< < >

Sample Output 2

C
