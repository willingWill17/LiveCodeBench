QUESTION TITLE:
--------------------
Annoying String Problem

DIFFICULTY:
--------------------
hard

QUESTION CONTENT:
--------------------
For strings S and T consisting of lowercase English letters, and a string X consisting of 0 and 1, define the string f(S,T,X) consisting of lowercase English letters as follows:

- Starting with an empty string, for each i=1,2,\dots,|X|, append S to the end if the i-th character of X is 0, and append T to the end if it is 1.

You are given a string S consisting of lowercase English letters, and strings X and Y consisting of 0 and 1.
Determine if there exists a string T (which can be empty) such that f(S,T,X)=f(S,T,Y).
You have t test cases to solve.

Input

The input is given from Standard Input in the following format:
t
\mathrm{case}_1
\vdots
\mathrm{case}_t

Each case is given in the following format:
S
X
Y

Output

Print t lines. The i-th line should contain Yes if there exists a T that satisfies the condition for the i-th test case, and No otherwise.

Constraints


- 1 \leq t \leq 5 \times 10^5
- 1 \leq |S| \leq 5\times 10^5
- 1 \leq |X|,|Y| \leq 5\times 10^5
- S is a string consisting of lowercase English letters.
- X and Y are strings consisting of 0 and 1.
- The sum of |S| across all test cases in a single input is at most 5 \times 10^5.
- The sum of |X| across all test cases in a single input is at most 5 \times 10^5.
- The sum of |Y| across all test cases in a single input is at most 5 \times 10^5.

Sample Input 1

3
araara
01
111
araaaa
100100
0010111
abacabac
0
1111

Sample Output 1

Yes
No
No

Below, string concatenation is represented using +.
For the 1st test case, if T=ara, then f(S,T,X)=S+T=araaraara and f(S,T,Y)=T+T+T=araaraara, so f(S,T,X)=f(S,T,Y).
For the 2nd and 3rd test cases, there is no T that satisfies the condition.

Sample Input 2

2
empty
10101
00
empty
11111
111

Sample Output 2

Yes
Yes

T can be empty.
