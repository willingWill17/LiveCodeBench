QUESTION TITLE:
--------------------
Sleep Log

DIFFICULTY:
--------------------
hard

QUESTION CONTENT:
--------------------
Takahashi keeps a sleep log.
The log is represented as an odd-length sequence A=(A _ 1(=0), A _ 2,\ldots,A _ N), where odd-numbered elements represent times he got up, and even-numbered elements represent times he went to bed.
More formally, he had the following sleep sessions after starting the sleep log.

- For every integer i such that 1\leq i\leq\dfrac{N-1}2, he fell asleep exactly A _ {2i} minutes after starting the sleep log and woke up exactly A _ {2i+1} minutes after starting the sleep log.
- He did not fall asleep or wake up at any other time.

Answer the following Q questions.
For the i-th question, you are given a pair of integers (l _ i,r _ i) such that 0\leq l _ i\leq r _ i\leq A _ N.

- What is the total number of minutes for which Takahashi was asleep during the r _ i-l _ i minutes from exactly l _ i minutes to r _ i minutes after starting the sleep log?

Input

The input is given from Standard Input in the following format:
N
A _ 1 A _ 2 \ldots A _ N
Q
l _ 1 r _ 1
l _ 2 r _ 2
\vdots
l _ Q r _ Q

Output

Print the answer in Q lines.
The i-th line should contain an integer answering to the i-th question.

Constraints


- 3\leq N\lt2\times10^5
- N is odd.
- 0=A _ 1\lt A _ 2\lt\cdots\lt A _ N\leq10^9
- 1\leq Q\leq2\times10^5
- 0\leq l _ i\leq r _ i\leq A _ N\ (1\leq i\leq Q)
- All input values are integers.

3
480 1920

0 2160

Sample Output 1

480

960

Takahashi slept as shown in the following figure.

The answers to each question are as follows.

- Between 480 minutes and 1920 minutes after starting the sleep log, Takahashi slept from 480 minutes to 720 minutes, from 1320 minutes to 1440 minutes, and from 1800 minutes to 1920 minutes in 3 sleep sessions. The total sleep time is 240+120+120=480 minutes.
- Between 720 minutes and 1200 minutes after starting the sleep log, Takahashi did not sleep. The total sleep time is 0 minutes.
- Between 0 minutes and 2160 minutes after starting the sleep log, Takahashi slept from 240 minutes to 720 minutes, from 1320 minutes to 1440 minutes, and from 1800 minutes to 2160 minutes in 3 sleep sessions. The total sleep time is 480+120+360=960 minutes.

Therefore, the three lines of the output should contain 480, 0, and 960.
