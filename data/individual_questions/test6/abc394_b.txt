easy

QUESTION CONTENT:
--------------------
You are given N strings S_1, S_2, \ldots, S_N, each consisting of lowercase English letters. The lengths of these strings are all distinct.
Sort these strings in ascending order of length, and then concatenate them in that order to form a single string.

Input

The input is given from Standard Input in the following format:
N
S_1
S_2
\vdots
S_N

Output

Print the answer.

Constraints


- 2 \leq N \leq 50
- N is an integer.
- Each S_i is a string consisting of lowercase English letters with length between 1 and 50, inclusive.
- If i \neq j, the length of S_i is different from the length of S_j.

Sample Input 1

3
tc
oder
a

Sample Output 1

atcoder

When we sort (tc, oder, a) in ascending order of length, we get (a, tc, oder). Concatenating them in this order yields the string atcoder.

Sample Input 2

4
cat
enate
on
c

Sample Output 2

concatenate
