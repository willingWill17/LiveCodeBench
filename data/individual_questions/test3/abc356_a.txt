QUESTION TITLE:
--------------------
Subsegment Reverse

DIFFICULTY:
--------------------
easy

QUESTION CONTENT:
--------------------
You are given positive integers N, L, and R.
For a sequence A = (1, 2, \dots, N) of length N, an operation of reversing the L-th through R-th elements was performed once.
Print the sequence after this operation.

Input

The input is given from Standard Input in the following format:
N L R

Output

Let A' = (A'_1, A'_2, \dots, A'_N) be the sequence after the operation. Print it in the following format:
A'_1 A'_2 \dots A'_N

Constraints


- All input values are integers.
- 1 \leq L \leq R \leq N \leq 100

Sample Input 1

5 2 3

Sample Output 1

1 3 2 4 5

Initially, A = (1, 2, 3, 4, 5).
After reversing the second through third elements, the sequence becomes (1, 3, 2, 4, 5), which should be printed.

Sample Input 2

7 1 1

Sample Output 2

1 2 3 4 5 6 7

It is possible that L = R.

Sample Input 3

10 1 10

Sample Output 3

10 9 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 1

It is possible that L = 1 or R = N.
