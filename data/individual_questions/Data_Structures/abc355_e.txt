QUESTION TITLE:
--------------------
Guess the Sum

DIFFICULTY:

hard

QUESTION CONTENT:
--------------------
This is an interactive problem (where your program interacts with the judge via input and output).
You are given a positive integer N and integers L and R such that 0 \leq L \leq R < 2^N. The judge has a hidden sequence A = (A_0, A_1, \dots, A_{2^N-1}) consisting of integers between 0 and 99, inclusive.
Your goal is to find the remainder when A_L + A_{L+1} + \dots + A_R is divided by 100. However, you cannot directly know the values of the elements in the sequence A. Instead, you can ask the judge the following question:

- Choose non-negative integers i and j such that 2^i(j+1) \leq 2^N. Let l = 2^i j and r = 2^i (j+1) - 1. Ask for the remainder when A_l + A_{l+1} + \dots + A_r is divided by 100.

Let m be the minimum number of questions required to determine the remainder when A_L + A_{L+1} + \dots + A_R is divided by 100 for any sequence A. You need to find this remainder within m questions.

Input and Output

This is an interactive problem (where your program interacts with the judge via input and output).
First, read the integers N, L, and R from Standard Input:
N L R

Then, repeat asking questions until you can determine the remainder when A_L + A_{L+1} + \dots + A_R is divided by 100. Each question should be printed in the following format:
? i j

Here, i and j must satisfy the following constraints:

- i and j are non-negative integers.
- 2^i(j+1) \leq 2^N

The response to the question will be given in the following format from Standard Input:
T

Here, T is the answer to the question, which is the remainder when A_l + A_{l+1} + \dots + A_r is divided by 100, where l = 2^i j and r = 2^i (j+1) - 1.
If i and j do not satisfy the constraints, or if the number of questions exceeds m, then T will be -1.
If the judge returns -1, your program is already considered incorrect. In this case, terminate the program immediately.
Once you have determined the remainder when A_L + A_{L+1} + \dots + A_R is divided by 100, print the remainder S in the following format and terminate the program immediately:
! S

! S

Constraints
