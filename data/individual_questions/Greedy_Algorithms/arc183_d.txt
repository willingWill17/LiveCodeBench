QUESTION TITLE:
--------------------
Keep Perfectly Matched

DIFFICULTY:
--------------------
hard

QUESTION CONTENT:
--------------------
There is a tree with N vertices numbered from 1 to N.
The i-th edge connects vertices A_i and B_i.
Here, N is even, and furthermore, this tree has a perfect matching.
Specifically, for each i (1 \leq i \leq N/2), it is guaranteed that A_i=i \times 2-1 and B_i=i \times 2.
You will perform the following operation N/2 times:

- Choose two leaves (vertices with degree exactly 1) and remove them from the tree.
Here, the tree after removal must still have a perfect matching.
In this problem, we consider a graph with zero vertices to be a tree as well.

For each operation, its score is defined as the distance between the two chosen vertices (the number of edges on the simple path connecting the two vertices).
Show one procedure that maximizes the total score.
It can be proved that there always exists a procedure to complete N/2 operations under the constraints of this problem.

Input

The input is given from Standard Input in the following format:
N
A_1 B_1
A_2 B_2
\vdots
A_{N-1} B_{N-1}

Output

Print a solution in the following format:
X_1 Y_1
X_2 Y_2
\vdots
X_{N/2} Y_{N/2}

Here, X_i and Y_i are the two vertices chosen in the i-th operation.
If there are multiple solutions, you may print any of them.

Constraints


- 2 \leq N \leq 250000
- N is even.
- 1 \leq A_i < B_i \leq N (1 \leq i \leq N-1)
- A_i=i \times 2 -1, B_i=i \times 2 (1 \leq i \leq N/2)
- The given graph is a tree.
- All input values are integers.

Sample Input 1

4
1 2
3 4
2 3

Sample Output 1

4 1
2 3

The procedure in the sample output is as follows:

- 1st operation: Remove vertices 4 and 1. The remaining tree has vertices 2 and 3, and a perfect matching. The score of this operation is 3.
- 2nd operation: Remove vertices 2 and 3. The remaining tree has zero vertices and a perfect matching. The score of this operation is 1.
- The total score is 3 + 1 = 4.

It is impossible to make the total score greater than 4, so this output solves this sample input.
