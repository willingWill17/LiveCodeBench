easy

QUESTION CONTENT:
--------------------
You are given a positive integer N.
If there are integers x and y such that N=2^x3^y, print Yes; otherwise, print No.

Input

The input is given from Standard Input in the following format:
N

Output

Print a single line containing Yes if there are integers x and y that satisfy the condition, and No otherwise.

Constraints


- 1\leq N\leq10^{18}
- N is an integer.

Sample Input 1

324

Sample Output 1

Yes

For x=2,y=4, we have 2^x3^y=2^23^4=4\times81=324, so the condition is satisfied.
Thus, you should print Yes.

Sample Input 2

5

Sample Output 2

No

There are no integers x and y such that 2^x3^y=5.
Thus, you should print No.

Sample Input 3

32

Sample Output 3

Yes

For x=5,y=0, we have 2^x3^y=32\times1=32, so you should print Yes.

Sample Input 4

37748736

Sample Output 4

Yes
