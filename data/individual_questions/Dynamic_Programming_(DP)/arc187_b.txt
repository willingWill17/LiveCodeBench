QUESTION CONTENT:
--------------------
For a sequence A = (A_1, \ldots, A_N) of length N, define f(A) as follows.

- Prepare a graph with N vertices labeled 1 to N and zero edges. For every integer pair (i, j) satisfying 1 \leq i < j \leq N, if A_i \leq A_j, draw a bidirectional edge connecting vertices i and j. Define f(A) as the number of connected components in the resulting graph.

You are given a sequence B = (B_1, \ldots, B_N) of length N. Each element of B is -1 or an integer between 1 and M, inclusive.
By replacing every occurrence of -1 in B with an integer between 1 and M, one can obtain M^q sequences B', where q is the number of -1 in B.
Find the sum, modulo 998244353, of f(B') over all possible B'.

Input

The input is given from Standard Input in the following format:
N M
B_1 \ldots B_N

Output

Print the answer.

Constraints


- All input numbers are integers.
- 2 \leq N \leq 2000
- 1 \leq M \leq 2000
- Each B_i is -1 or an integer between 1 and M, inclusive.

Sample Input 1

3 3
2 -1 1

Sample Output 1

6

There are three possible sequences B': (2,1,1), (2,2,1), and (2,3,1).
When B' = (2,1,1), an edge is drawn only between vertices 2 andÂ 3, so the number of connected components is 2. Thus, f(B') = 2.
Similarly, f(B') = 2 for B' = (2,2,1) and f(B') = 2 for B' = (2,3,1), so the answer is 2 + 2 + 2 = 6.
