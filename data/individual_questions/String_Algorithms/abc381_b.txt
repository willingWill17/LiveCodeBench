QUESTION TITLE:
--------------------
1122 String

DIFFICULTY:
--------------------
easy

QUESTION CONTENT:
--------------------
A string T is called a 1122 string if and only if it satisfies all of the following three conditions:

- \lvert T \rvert is even. Here, \lvert T \rvert denotes the length of T.
- For each integer i satisfying 1\leq i\leq \frac{|T|}{2}, the (2i-1)-th and 2i-th characters of T are equal.
- Each character appears in T exactly zero or two times. That is, every character contained in T appears exactly twice in T.

Given a string S consisting of lowercase English letters, print Yes if S is a 1122 string, and No otherwise.

Input

The input is given from Standard Input in the following format:
S

Output

If S is a 1122 string, print Yes; otherwise, print No.

Constraints


- S is a string of length between 1 and 100, inclusive, consisting of lowercase English letters.

Sample Input 1

aabbcc

Sample Output 1

Yes

S=aabbcc satisfies all the conditions for a 1122 string, so print Yes.

Sample Input 2

aab

Sample Output 2

No

S=aab has an odd length and does not satisfy the first condition, so print No.

Sample Input 3

zzzzzz

Sample Output 3

No

S=zzzzzz contains six zs and does not satisfy the third condition, so print No.
