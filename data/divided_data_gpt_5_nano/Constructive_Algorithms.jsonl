Here, R+B is not less than 2. The square at the r-th row from the top and the c-th column from the left is called square (r,c). A red piece can move vertically or horizontally by one square in one move, and a blue piece can move diagonally by one square in one move. More precisely, a red piece on square (r,c) can move to (r+1,c), (r,c+1), (r-1,c), (r,c-1) in one move if the destination square exists, and a blue piece on square (r,c) can move to (r+1,c+1), (r+1,c-1), (r-1,c+1), (r-1,c-1) in one move if the destination square exists.\nWe want to place all (R+B) pieces on the board in any order, one by one, subject to the following conditions:\n\n- At most one piece is placed on a single square.\n- For each i (1 \\leq i \\leq R+B-1), the i-th piece placed can move in one move to the square containing the (i+1)-th piece placed.\n- The (R+B)-th piece placed can move in one move to the square containing the 1-st piece placed.\n\nDetermine whether there is a way to place the (R+B) pieces satisfying these conditions. If it exists, show one example.\nYou are given T test cases; solve each of them.\n\nInput\n\nThe input is given from Standard Input in the following format:\nT\n\\mathrm{case}_1\n\\mathrm{case}_2\n\\vdots\n\\mathrm{case}_T\n\nEach case is given in the following format:\nR B\n\nOutput\n\nPrint the answer for each test case in order, separated by newlines.\nIf there is no way to place the pieces satisfying the conditions for a test case, print No.\nOtherwise, print such a placement in the following format:\nYes\np_1 r_1 c_1\n\\vdots\np_{R+B} r_{R+B} c_{R+B}\n\nHere, p_i is R if the i-th piece placed is red, and B if it is blue. r_i and c_i are integers between 1 and 10^9 (inclusive), indicating that the i-th piece is placed on square (r_i,c_i).\n\nConstraints\n\n\n- 1\\leq T\\leq 10^5\n- 0 \\leq R, B\n- 2 \\leq R + B \\leq 2 \\times 10^5\n- The sum of (R+B) over all test cases is at most 2\\times 10^5.\n- All input values are integers.\n\nSample Input 1\n\n3\n2 3\n1 1\n4 0\n\nSample Output 1\n\nYes\nB 2 3\nR 3 2 \nB 2 2\nB 3 3\nR 2 4\nNo\nYes\nR 1 1\nR 1 2\nR 2 2\nR 2 1\n\nFor the 1st test case, if we extract the top-left 4\\times 5 squares of the board, the placement of the pieces is as follows:\n.....\n.BBR.\n.RB..\n.....\n\nHere, R indicates a red piece on that square, B indicates a blue piece on that square, and . indicates an empty square.\nFor the 2nd test case, there is no placement of the pieces that satisfies the conditions.", "difficulty": "hard", "starter_code": "", "public_test_cases": "[{\"input\": \"3\\n2 3\\n1 1\\n4 0\", \"output\": \"Yes\\nB 2 3\\nR 3 2 \\nB 2 2\\nB 3 3\\nR 2 4\\nNo\\nYes\\nR 1 1\\nR 1 2\\nR 2 2\\nR 2 1\", \"testtype\": \"stdin\"}]"}
