Operations on a Stack

QUESTION CONTENT:
--------------------
You are given an integer sequence of length N: (A_1, A_2, \ldots, A_N). There is also a sequence S, which is initially empty.
For each i = 1, 2, \ldots, N in this order, you perform exactly one of the following two operations:

- Append A_i as an element to the end of S.
- Delete the last element of S. You cannot choose this operation if S is empty.

Print the maximum possible value of the sum of the elements of S after all operations.

Input

The input is given from Standard Input in the following format:
N
A_1 A_2 \ldots A_N

Output

Print the answer.

Constraints


- 1 \leq N \leq 2 \times 10^5
- -10^9 \leq A_i \leq 10^9
- All input values are integers.

Sample Input 1

6
3 -1 -4 5 -9 2

Sample Output 1

8

Starting from the initial state where S is an empty sequence, consider the following operations:

- For i = 1, append A_1 = 3 to the end of S. Now, S = (3).
- For i = 2, append A_2 = -1 to the end of S. Now, S = (3, -1).
- For i = 3, delete the last element of S. Now, S = (3).
- For i = 4, append A_4 = 5 to the end of S. Now, S = (3, 5).
- For i = 5, append A_5 = -9 to the end of S. Now, S = (3, 5, -9).
- For i = 6, delete the last element of S. Now, S = (3, 5).

Here, the sum of the elements of S after all operations is 3 + 5 = 8, which is the maximum possible value.

Sample Input 2

1
-1

Sample Output 2

-1

Note that if S is empty, you must choose to append an element.

Sample Input 3

20
-14 74 -48 38 -51 43 5 37 -39 -29 80 -44 -55 59 17 89 -37 -68 38 -16

Sample Output 3

369
