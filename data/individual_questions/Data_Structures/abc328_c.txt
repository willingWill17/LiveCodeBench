QUESTION CONTENT:
--------------------
You are given a string S = S_1S_2\ldots S_N of length N consisting of lowercase English letters.
Additionally, you are given Q queries about the string S.
For i = 1, 2, \ldots, Q, the i-th query is represented by two integers l_i, r_i and asks the following.

In the substring S_{l_i}S_{l_i+1}\ldots S_{r_i} of S, which ranges from the l_i-th to the r_i-th character, how many places are there where the same lowercase English letter occurs twice in a row?
In other words, how many integers p satisfy l_i \leq p \leq r_i-1 and S_p = S_{p+1}?

Print the answer for each of the Q queries.

Input

The input is given from Standard Input in the following format:
N Q
S
l_1 r_1
l_2 r_2
\vdots
l_Q r_Q

Output

Print Q lines.
For i = 1, 2, \ldots, Q, the i-th line should contain the answer to the i-th query.

Constraints


- N and Q are integers.
- 1 \leq N, Q \leq 3 \times 10^5
- S is a string of length N consisting of lowercase English letters.
- l_i and r_i are integers.
- 1 \leq l_i \leq r_i \leq N

The answers to the four queries are as follows.

- For the first query, S_3S_4\ldots S_9 =  ssissip has two places where the same lowercase English letter occurs twice in a row: S_3S_4 =  ss and S_6S_7 =  ss.
- For the second query, S_4S_5\ldots S_{10} =  sissipp has two places where the same lowercase English letter occurs twice in a row: S_6S_7 =  ss and S_9S_{10} =  pp.
- For the third query, S_4S_5S_6 =  sis has zero places where the same lowercase English letter occurs twice in a row.
- For the fourth query, S_7 =  s has zero places where the same lowercase English letter occurs twice in a row.

Sample Input 2

5 1
aaaaa
1 5

Sample Output 2

4

S_1S_2\ldots S_5 =  aaaaa has four places where the same lowercase English letter occurs twice in a row:
S_1S_2 =  aa, S_2S_3 =  aa, S_3S_4 =  aa, and S_4S_5 =  aa.
