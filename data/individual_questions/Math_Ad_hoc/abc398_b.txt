QUESTION CONTENT:
--------------------
We have seven cards.  The i-th card (i=1,\ldots,7) has an integer A_i written on it.
Determine whether it is possible to choose five of them so that the chosen cards form a full house.
A set of five cards is called a full house if and only if the following conditions are satisfied:

- For different integers x and y, there are three cards with x and two cards with y.

Input

The input is given from Standard Input in the following format:
A_1 A_2 A_3 A_4 A_5 A_6 A_7

Output

If a full house can be formed by choosing five cards, print Yes; otherwise, print No.

Constraints


- A_i is an integer between 1 and 13, inclusive.

Sample Input 1

1 4 1 4 2 1 3

Yes

For example, by choosing the cards (1,1,1,4,4), we can form a full house.

Sample Input 2

11 12 13 10 13 12 11

Sample Output 2

No

No five cards chosen from the seven cards form a full house.

Sample Input 3

7 7 7 7 7 7 7
