QUESTION TITLE:
--------------------
smallest-substring-with-identical-characters-i

DIFFICULTY:
--------------------
hard

QUESTION CONTENT:
--------------------
You are given a binary string s of length n and an integer numOps.
You are allowed to perform the following operation on s at most numOps times:

Select any index i (where 0 <= i < n) and flip s[i]. If s[i] == '1', change s[i] to '0' and vice versa.

You need to minimize the length of the longest substring of s such that all the characters in the substring are identical.
Return the minimum length after the operations.
 
Example 1:

Input: s = "000001", numOps = 1
Output: 2
Explanation: 
By changing s[2] to '1', s becomes "001001". The longest substrings with identical characters are s[0..1] and s[3..4].

Example 2:

Input: s = "0000", numOps = 2
Output: 1
Explanation: 
By changing s[0] and s[2] to '1', s becomes "1010".

Example 3:

Input: s = "0101", numOps = 0
Output: 1

 
Constraints:

1 <= n == s.length <= 1000
s consists only of '0' and '1'.
0 <= numOps <= n

    def minLength(self, s: str, numOps: int) -> int:
