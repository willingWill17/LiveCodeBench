QUESTION TITLE:
--------------------
Colorful Bracket Sequence

DIFFICULTY:
--------------------
medium

QUESTION CONTENT:
--------------------
You are given a string S consisting of six types of characters: (, ), [, ], <, >.
A string T is called a colorful bracket sequence if it satisfies the following condition:

It is possible to turn T into an empty string by repeating the following operation any number of times (possibly zero):

- If there exists a contiguous substring of T that is one of (), [], or <>, choose one such substring and delete it.
- If the deleted substring was at the beginning or end of T, the remainder becomes the new T.
- Otherwise, concatenate the part before the deleted substring and the part after the deleted substring, and that becomes the new T.


Determine whether S is a colorful bracket sequence.

Input

The input is given from Standard Input in the following format:
S

Output

If S is a colorful bracket sequence, print Yes; otherwise, print No.

Constraints


- S is a string of length between 1 and 2\times 10^5, inclusive.
- S consists of (, ), [, ], <, >.

Sample Input 1

([])<>()

Sample Output 1

Yes

For S=([])<>(), it is possible to turn it into an empty string by repeating the operation as follows:

- Delete the substring [] from the 2nd to the 3rd character in ([])<>(), then concatenate the parts before and after it. The string becomes ()<>().
- Delete the substring () from the 1st to the 2nd character in ()<>(). The string becomes <>().
- Delete the substring <> from the 1st to the 2nd character in <>(). The string becomes ().
- Delete the substring () from the 1st to the 2nd character in (). The string becomes empty.

Thus, S=([])<>() is a colorful bracket sequence, so print Yes.

Sample Input 2

([<)]>

Sample Output 2

No

Since S=([<)]> does not contain (), [], or <> as a contiguous substring, we cannot perform the 1st operation, and in particular S is not a colorful bracket sequence. Therefore, print No.

Sample Input 3

())

Sample Output 3

No

It is impossible to turn S into an empty string by repeating the operations.
Therefore, S is not a colorful bracket sequence, so print No.
