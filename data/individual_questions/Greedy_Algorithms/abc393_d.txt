QUESTION TITLE:
--------------------
Swap to Gather

DIFFICULTY:
--------------------
hard

QUESTION CONTENT:
--------------------
You are given a string S of length N consisting of 0 and 1. It is guaranteed that S contains at least one 1.
You may perform the following operation any number of times (possibly zero):

- Choose an integer i (1 \leq i \leq N-1) and swap the i-th and (i+1)-th characters of S.

Find the minimum number of operations needed so that all 1s are contiguous.
Here, all 1s are said to be contiguous if and only if there exist integers l and r (1 \leq l \leq r \leq N) such that the i-th character of S is 1 if and only if l \leq i \leq r, and 0 otherwise.

Input

The input is given from Standard Input in the following format:
N
S

Output

Print the answer.

Constraints


- 2 \leq N \leq 5 \times 10^5
- N is an integer.
- S is a length N string of 0 and 1.
- S contains at least one 1.

Sample Input 1

7
0101001

Sample Output 1

3

For example, the following three operations make all 1s contiguous:

- Choose i=2 and swap the 2nd and 3rd characters. Then, S= 0011001.
- Choose i=6 and swap the 6th and 7th characters. Then, S= 0011010.
- Choose i=5 and swap the 5th and 6th characters. Then, S= 0011100.

It is impossible to do this in two or fewer swaps, so the answer is 3.

Sample Input 2

3
100

Sample Output 2

0

All 1s are already contiguous, so no swaps are needed.

Sample Input 3

10
0101001001

Sample Output 3

7
