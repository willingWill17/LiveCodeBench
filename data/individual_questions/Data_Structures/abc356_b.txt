DIFFICULTY:

easy

QUESTION CONTENT:
--------------------
Takahashi is health-conscious and concerned about whether he is getting enough of M types of nutrients from his diet.
For the i-th nutrient, his goal is to take at least A_i units per day.
Today, he ate N foods, and from the i-th food, he took X_{i,j} units of nutrient j.
Determine whether he has met the goal for all M types of nutrients.

Input

The input is given from Standard Input in the following format:
N M
A_1 \ldots A_M
X_{1,1} \ldots X_{1,M}
\vdots
X_{N,1} \ldots X_{N,M}

Output

Print Yes if the goal is met for all M types of nutrients, and No otherwise.

Constraints


- 1 \leq N \leq 100
- 1 \leq M \leq 100
- 0 \leq A_i, X_{i,j} \leq 10^7
- All input values are integers.

Sample Input 1

2 3
10 20 30
20 0 10
0 100 100

Sample Output 1

Yes

For nutrient 1, Takahashi took 20 units from the 1-st food and 0 units from the 2-nd food, totaling 20 units, thus meeting the goal of taking at least 10 units.
Similarly, he meets the goal for nutrients 2 and 3.

Sample Input 2

2 4
10 20 30 40
20 0 10 30
0 100 100 0

Sample Output 2

No

The goal is not met for nutrient 4.
