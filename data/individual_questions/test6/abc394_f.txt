QUESTION TITLE:
--------------------
Alkane

DIFFICULTY:
--------------------
hard

QUESTION CONTENT:
--------------------
You are given an undirected tree T with N vertices, numbered 1, 2, \ldots, N. The i-th edge is an undirected edge connecting vertices A_i and B_i.
A graph is defined to be an alkane if and only if it satisfies the following conditions:

- The graph is an undirected tree.
- Every vertex has degree 1 or 4, and there is at least one vertex of degree 4.

Determine whether there exists a subgraph of T that is an alkane, and if so, find the maximum number of vertices in such a subgraph.

Input

The input is given from Standard Input in the following format:
N
A_1 B_1
A_2 B_2
\vdots
A_{N - 1} B_{N - 1}

Output

If there exists a subgraph of T that is an alkane, print the maximum number of vertices in such a subgraph. Otherwise, print -1.

Constraints


- 1 \leq N \leq 2 \times 10^5
- 1 \leq A_i, B_i \leq N
- The given graph is an undirected tree.
- All input values are integers.
