Airport Code

DIFFICULTY:
--------------------
medium

QUESTION CONTENT:
--------------------
A string T of length 3 consisting of uppercase English letters is an airport code for a string S of lowercase English letters if and only if T can be derived from S by one of the following methods:

- Take a subsequence of length 3 from S (not necessarily contiguous) and convert it to uppercase letters to form T.
- Take a subsequence of length 2 from S (not necessarily contiguous), convert it to uppercase letters, and append X to the end to form T.

Given strings S and T, determine if T is an airport code for S.

Input

The input is given from Standard Input in the following format:
S
T

Output

Print Yes if T is an airport code for S, and No otherwise.

Constraints


- S is a string of lowercase English letters with a length between 3 and 10^5, inclusive.
- T is a string of uppercase English letters with a length of 3.

Sample Input 1

narita
NRT

Sample Output 1

Yes

The subsequence nrt of narita, when converted to uppercase, forms the string NRT, which is an airport code for narita.

Sample Input 2

losangeles
LAX

Sample Output 2

Yes

The subsequence la of losangeles, when converted to uppercase and appended with X, forms the string LAX, which is an airport code for losangeles.

Sample Input 3

snuke
RNG

Sample Output 3

No
