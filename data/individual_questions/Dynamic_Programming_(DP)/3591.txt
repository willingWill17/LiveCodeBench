QUESTION TITLE:

shift-distance-between-two-strings

DIFFICULTY:
--------------------
medium

QUESTION CONTENT:
--------------------
You are given two strings s and t of the same length, and two integer arrays nextCost and previousCost.
In one operation, you can pick any index i of s, and perform either one of the following actions:

Shift s[i] to the next letter in the alphabet. If s[i] == 'z', you should replace it with 'a'. This operation costs nextCost[j] where j is the index of s[i] in the alphabet.
Shift s[i] to the previous letter in the alphabet. If s[i] == 'a', you should replace it with 'z'. This operation costs previousCost[j] where j is the index of s[i] in the alphabet.

The shift distance is the minimum total cost of operations required to transform s into t.
Return the shift distance from s to t.
 
Example 1:

Input: s = "abab", t = "baba", nextCost = [100,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0], previousCost = [1,100,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]
Output: 2
Explanation:

We choose index i = 0 and shift s[0] 25 times to the previous character for a total cost of 1.
We choose index i = 1 and shift s[1] 25 times to the next character for a total cost of 0.
We choose index i = 2 and shift s[2] 25 times to the previous character for a total cost of 1.
We choose index i = 3 and shift s[3] 25 times to the next character for a total cost of 0.


Example 2:

Input: s = "leet", t = "code", nextCost = [1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1], previousCost = [1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1]
Output: 31
Explanation:

We choose index i = 0 and shift s[0] 9 times to the previous character for a total cost of 9.
We choose index i = 1 and shift s[1] 10 times to the next character for a total cost of 10.
We choose index i = 2 and shift s[2] 1 time to the previous character for a total cost of 1.
We choose index i = 3 and shift s[3] 11 times to the next character for a total cost of 11.


 
Constraints:

1 <= s.length == t.length <= 10^5
s and t consist only of lowercase English letters.
nextCost.length == previousCost.length == 26
0 <= nextCost[i], previousCost[i] <= 10^9
