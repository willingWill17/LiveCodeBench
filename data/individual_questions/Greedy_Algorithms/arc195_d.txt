QUESTION TITLE:
--------------------
Swap and Erase

DIFFICULTY:
--------------------
hard

QUESTION CONTENT:
--------------------
There is a sequence A = (A_1,\ldots,A_N). You can perform the following two types of operations any number of times in any order:

- Let K be the length of A just before the operation. Choose an integer i such that 1 \leq i \leq K-1, and swap the i-th and (i+1)-th elements of A.
- Let K be the length of A just before the operation. Choose an integer i such that 1 \leq i \leq K and all the values from the 1-st through the i-th elements of A are equal, and delete all the elements from the 1-st through the i-th of A.

Find the minimum total number of operations required to make A an empty sequence.
You are given T test cases; solve each of them.

Input

The input is given from Standard Input in the following format:
T
\mathrm{case}_1
\mathrm{case}_2
\vdots
\mathrm{case}_T

Each case is given in the following format:
N
A_1 A_2 \ldots A_N

Output

Print the answer for each test case in order, separated by newlines.

Constraints


- 1\leq T\leq 10^5
- 2 \leq N \leq 2 \times 10^5
- 1 \leq A_i \leq N
- The sum of N over all test cases is at most 2\times 10^5.
- All input values are integers.

Sample Input 1

3
5
1 1 2 1 2
4
4 2 1 3
11
1 2 1 2 1 2 1 2 1 2 1

Sample Output 1

3
4
8

For the 1st test case, A can be made empty by the following three operations:

- Swap the 3rd and 4th elements of A. Now, A is (1,1,1,2,2).
- Delete the 1st through 3rd elements of A. Now, A is (2,2).
- Delete the 1st through 2nd elements of A. Now, A is an empty sequence.

For the 2nd test case, A can be made empty by deleting the 1st element four times. Also, it is impossible to make A empty in three or fewer operations.
