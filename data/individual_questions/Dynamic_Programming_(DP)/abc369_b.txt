QUESTION TITLE:
--------------------
Piano 3

DIFFICULTY:
--------------------
easy

QUESTION CONTENT:
--------------------
Takahashi has a piano with 100 keys arranged in a row.
The i-th key from the left is called key i.
He will play music by pressing N keys one by one.
For the i-th press, he will press key A_i, using his left hand if S_i= L, and his right hand if S_i= R.
Before starting to play, he can place both of his hands on any keys he likes, and his fatigue level at this point is 0.
During the performance, if he moves one hand from key x to key y, the fatigue level increases by |y-x| (conversely, the fatigue level does not increase for any reason other than moving hands).
To press a certain key with a hand, that hand must be placed on that key.
Find the minimum possible fatigue level at the end of the performance.

Input

The input is given from Standard Input in the following format:
N
A_1 S_1
A_2 S_2
\vdots
A_N S_N

Output

Print the minimum fatigue level at the end of the performance.

Constraints


- 1 \leq N \leq 100
- 1 \leq A_i \leq 100
- N and A_i are integers.
- S_i is L or R.

Sample Input 1

4
3 L
6 R
9 L
1 R

Sample Output 1

11

For example, the performance can be done as follows:

- Initially, place the left hand on key 3 and the right hand on key 6.
- Press key 3 with the left hand.
- Press key 6 with the right hand.
- Move the left hand from key 3 to key 9. The fatigue level increases by |9-3| = 6.
- Move the right hand from key 6 to key 1. The fatigue level increases by |1-6| = 5.
- Press key 9 with the left hand.
- Press key 1 with the right hand.

In this case, the fatigue level at the end of the performance is 6+5 = 11, which is the minimum possible.

22 L
75 L
26 R
45 R
72 R
81 R
