QUESTION TITLE:
--------------------
Flip Edge

DIFFICULTY:

hard

QUESTION CONTENT:
--------------------
You are given a directed graph with N vertices and M edges.
The i-th edge (1 \leq i \leq M) is a directed edge from vertex u _ i to vertex v _ i.
Initially, you are at vertex 1. You want to repeat the following operations until you reach vertex N:

- Perform one of the two operations below:
- Move along a directed edge from your current vertex. This incurs a cost of 1. More precisely, if you are at vertex v, choose a vertex u such that there is a directed edge from v to u, and move to vertex u.
- Reverse the direction of all edges. This incurs a cost of X. More precisely, if and only if there was a directed edge from v to u immediately before this operation, there is a directed edge from u to v immediately after this operation.



It is guaranteed that, for the given graph, you can reach vertex N from vertex 1 by repeating these operations.
Find the minimum total cost required to reach vertex N.

Input

The input is given from Standard Input in the following format:
N M X
u _ 1 v _ 1
u _ 2 v _ 2
\vdots
u _ M v _ M

Output

Print the minimum total cost required to reach vertex N.

Constraints


- 2 \leq N \leq 2 \times 10^5
- 1 \leq M \leq 2 \times 10^5
- 1 \leq X \leq 10^9
- 1 \leq u _ i \leq N \ (1 \leq i \leq M)
- 1 \leq v _ i \leq N \ (1 \leq i \leq M)
- For the given graph, it is guaranteed that you can reach vertex N from vertex 1 by the operations described.
- All input values are integers.

Sample Input 1

5 6 5
1 2
2 4
3 1
3 5
4 3
5 2

Sample Output 1

4

The given graph looks like this:

You can reach vertex 5 with a total cost of 4 by doing the following:

- Move to vertex 2 at a cost of 1.
- Move to vertex 4 at a cost of 1.
- Move to vertex 3 at a cost of 1.
- Move to vertex 5 at a cost of 1.

It is impossible to reach vertex 5 with a total cost of 3 or less, so print 4.

Sample Input 2

5 6 1
1 2
2 4
3 1
3 5
4 3
5 2

Sample Output 2

3

The graph is the same as in Sample 1, but the cost to reverse edges is different.
You can reach vertex 5 with a total cost of 3 as follows:

- Move to vertex 2 at a cost of 1.
- Reverse all edges at a cost of 1.
- Move to vertex 5 at a cost of 1.

It is impossible to reach vertex 5 with a total cost of 2 or less, so print 3.
