QUESTION TITLE:
--------------------
1122 Substring

DIFFICULTY:
--------------------
hard

QUESTION CONTENT:
--------------------
A sequence X = (X_1, X_2, \ldots) of positive integers (possibly empty) is called a 1122 sequence if and only if it satisfies all of the following three conditions: (The definition of a 1122 sequence is the same as in Problem F.)

- \lvert X \rvert is even. Here, \lvert X \rvert denotes the length of X.
- For each integer i satisfying 1\leq i\leq \frac{|X|}{2}, X_{2i-1} and X_{2i} are equal.
- Each positive integer appears in X either not at all or exactly twice. That is, every positive integer contained in X appears exactly twice in X.

Given a sequence A = (A_1, A_2, \ldots, A_N) of length N consisting of positive integers, print the maximum length of a (contiguous) subarray of A that is a 1122 sequence.

Input

The input is given from Standard Input in the following format:
N
A_1 A_2 \ldots A_N

Output

Print the maximum length of a (contiguous) subarray of A that is a 1122 sequence.

Constraints


- 1\leq N \leq 2 \times 10^5
- 1\leq A_i \leq N
- All input values are integers.

Sample Input 1

8
2 3 1 1 2 2 1 1

Sample Output 1

4

For example, taking the subarray from the 3-rd to 6-th elements of A, we get (1, 1, 2, 2), which is a 1122 sequence of length 4.
There is no longer (contiguous) subarray that satisfies the conditions for a 1122 sequence, so the answer is 4.

Sample Input 2

3
1 2 2

Sample Output 2

2

Sample Input 3

1
1

Sample Output 3

0

Note that a sequence of length 0 also satisfies the conditions for a 1122 sequence.
