Maximize Distance

DIFFICULTY:

hard

QUESTION CONTENT:
--------------------
You are given a directed graph with N vertices and M edges. The vertices are numbered 1,2,\dots,N. Edge j (j=1,2,\dots,M) goes from vertex u_j to vertex v_j. It is guaranteed that vertex N is reachable from vertex 1.
Initially, all edges have weight 0. We choose exactly K out of the M edges and change their weights to 1. Find the maximum possible value of the shortest distance from vertex 1 to vertex N in the resulting graph.

Input

The input is given from Standard Input in the following format:
N M K
u_1 v_1
u_2 v_2
\vdots
u_M v_M

Output

Print the answer.

Constraints


- 2 \leq N \leq 30
- 1 \leq K \leq M \leq 100
- 1 \leq u_j, v_j \leq N
- u_j \neq v_j
- In the given graph, vertex N is reachable from vertex 1.
- All input values are integers.

Sample Input 1

3 3 2
1 2
2 3
1 3

Sample Output 1

1

By choosing edges 1,3, the shortest distance from vertex 1 to vertex 3 becomes 1. There is no way to make the shortest distance 2 or greater, so the answer is 1.

Sample Input 2

4 4 3
1 2
1 3
3 2
2 4

Sample Output 2

2

By choosing edges 1,2,4, the shortest distance from vertex 1 to vertex 4 becomes 2. There is no way to make the shortest distance 3 or greater, so the answer is 2.

Sample Input 3

2 2 1
1 2
1 2

Sample Output 3

0

Note that there may be multi-edges.
