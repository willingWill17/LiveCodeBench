QUESTION TITLE:
--------------------
9x9 Sum

DIFFICULTY:
--------------------
easy

QUESTION CONTENT:
--------------------
Among the 81 integers that appear in the 9-by-9 multiplication table, find the sum of those that are not X.

There is a grid of size 9 by 9.
Each cell of the grid contains an integer: the cell at the i-th row from the top and the j-th column from the left contains i \times j.
You are given an integer X. Among the 81 integers written in this grid, find the sum of those that are not X. If the same value appears in multiple cells, add it for each cell.

Input

The input is given from Standard Input in the following format:
X

Output

Print the sum of the integers that are not X among the 81 integers written in the grid.

Constraints


- X is an integer between 1 and 81, inclusive.

Sample Input 1

1

Sample Output 1

2024

The only cell with 1 in the grid is the cell at the 1st row from the top and 1st column from the left. Summing all integers that are not 1 yields 2024.

Sample Input 2

11

Sample Output 2

2025

There is no cell containing 11 in the grid. Thus, the answer is 2025, the sum of all 81 integers.

Sample Input 3

24

Sample Output 3

1929
