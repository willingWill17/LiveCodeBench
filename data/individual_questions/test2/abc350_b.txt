easy

QUESTION CONTENT:
--------------------
Takahashi has N teeth, one in each of the holes numbered 1, 2, \dots, N.
Dentist Aoki will perform Q treatments on these teeth and holes.
In the i-th treatment, hole T_i is treated as follows:

- If there is a tooth in hole T_i, remove the tooth from hole T_i.
- If there is no tooth in hole T_i (i.e., the hole is empty), grow a tooth in hole T_i.

After all treatments are completed, how many teeth does Takahashi have?

Input

The input is given from Standard Input in the following format:
N Q
T_1 T_2 \dots T_Q

Output

Print the number of teeth as an integer.

Constraints


- All input values are integers.
- 1 \le N, Q \le 1000
- 1 \le T_i \le N

Sample Input 1

30 6
2 9 18 27 18 9

Sample Output 1

28

Initially, Takahashi has 30 teeth, and Aoki performs six treatments.

- In the first treatment, hole 2 is treated. There is a tooth in hole 2, so it is removed.
- In the second treatment, hole 9 is treated. There is a tooth in hole 9, so it is removed.
- In the third treatment, hole 18 is treated. There is a tooth in hole 18, so it is removed.
- In the fourth treatment, hole 27 is treated. There is a tooth in hole 27, so it is removed.
- In the fifth treatment, hole 18 is treated. There is no tooth in hole 18, so a tooth is grown.
- In the sixth treatment, hole 9 is treated. There is no tooth in hole 9, so a tooth is grown.

The final count of teeth is 28.
