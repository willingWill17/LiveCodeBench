DIFFICULTY:
--------------------
easy

QUESTION CONTENT:
--------------------
There is a mysterious button.
When you press this button, you receive one candy, unless less than C seconds have elapsed since you last received a candy.
Takahashi decided to press this button N times.
He will press the button for the i-th time T_i seconds from now.
How many candies will he receive?

Input

The input is given from Standard Input in the following format:
N C
T_1 T_2 \dots T_N

Output

Print the number of candies that Takahashi will receive.

Constraints


- 1 \leq N \leq 100
- 1 \leq C \leq 1000
- 0 \leq T_1 < T_2 < \dots < T_N \leq 1000
- All input values are integers.

Sample Input 1

6 5
1 3 7 8 10 12

Sample Output 1

3

Takahashi will press the button six times.

- 1st press (1 second from now): You always receive a candy when pressing the button for the first time.
- 2nd press (3 seconds from now): 3 - 1 = 2 < C seconds have elapsed since he last received a candy, so he does not receive a candy.
- 3rd press (7 seconds from now): 7 - 1 = 6 \geq C seconds have elapsed since he last received a candy, so he receives a candy.
- 4th press (8 seconds from now): 8 - 7 = 1 < C second has elapsed since he last received a candy, so he does not receive a candy.
- 5th press (10 seconds from now): 10 - 7 = 3 < C seconds have elapsed since he last received a candy, so he does not receive a candy.
- 6th press (12 seconds from now): 12 - 7 = 5 \geq C seconds have elapsed since he last received a candy, so he receives a candy.

Therefore, he receives three candies.
