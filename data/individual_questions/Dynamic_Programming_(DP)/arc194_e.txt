QUESTION TITLE:
--------------------
Swap 0^X and 1^Y

DIFFICULTY:
--------------------
hard

QUESTION CONTENT:
--------------------
You are given two strings S and T, each of length N and consisting of 0 and 1, as well as two positive integers X and Y. For i = 1, 2, \ldots, N, let S_i denote the i-th character of S.
Determine whether it is possible to make S identical to T by repeatedly performing Operations A and B below any number of times (possibly zero) in any order:

- 
(Operation A) Choose an integer i satisfying 1 \leq i \leq N-(X+Y)+1, S_{i} = S_{i+1} = \cdots = S_{i+X-1} = 0, and S_{i+X} = S_{i+X+1} = \cdots = S_{i+X+Y-1} = 1, then change each of S_{i}, S_{i+1}, \ldots, S_{i+Y-1} to 1 and each of S_{i+Y}, S_{i+Y+1}, \ldots, S_{i+Y+X-1} to 0.

- 
(Operation B) Choose an integer i satisfying 1 \leq i \leq N-(X+Y)+1, S_{i} = S_{i+1} = \cdots = S_{i+Y-1} = 1, and S_{i+Y} = S_{i+Y+1} = \cdots = S_{i+Y+X-1} = 0, then change each of S_{i}, S_{i+1}, \ldots, S_{i+X-1} to 0 and each of S_{i+X}, S_{i+X+1}, \ldots, S_{i+X+Y-1} to 1.

Input

The input is given from Standard Input in the following format:
N X Y
S
T

Output

If it is possible to make S identical to T, print Yes; otherwise, print No.

Constraints


- 1 \leq N \leq 5 \times 10^5
- 1 \leq X, Y \leq N
- S and T are strings of length N consisting of 0 and 1.
- All input values are integers.

Sample Input 1

9 2 1
000111001
011000011

Sample Output 1

Yes

The following procedure can transform S into T:

- First, perform Operation A with i = 2. Now, S = 010011001.
- Next, perform Operation B with i = 6. Now, S = 010010011.
- Finally, perform Operation A with i = 3. Now, S = 011000011.

Thus, print Yes.

Sample Input 2

1 1 1
0
1

Sample Output 2

No

It is impossible to make S identical to T. Thus, print No.
