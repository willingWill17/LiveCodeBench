QUESTION TITLE:
--------------------
1D Keyboard

DIFFICULTY:
--------------------
easy

QUESTION CONTENT:
--------------------
There is a keyboard with 26 keys arranged on a number line.
The arrangement of this keyboard is represented by a string S, which is a permutation of ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ.
The key corresponding to the character S_x is located at coordinate x (1 \leq x \leq 26). Here, S_x denotes the x-th character of S.
You will use this keyboard to input ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ in this order, typing each letter exactly once with your right index finger.
To input a character, you need to move your finger to the coordinate of the key corresponding to that character and press the key.
Initially, your finger is at the coordinate of the key corresponding to A. Find the minimal possible total traveled distance of your finger from pressing the key for A to pressing the key for Z. Here, pressing a key does not contribute to the distance.

Input

The input is given from Standard Input in the following format:
S

Output

Print the answer.

Constraints


- S is a permutation of ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ.

Sample Input 1

ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ

Sample Output 1

25

From pressing the key for A to pressing the key for Z, you need to move your finger 1 unit at a time in the positive direction, resulting in a total traveled distance of 25. It is impossible to press all keys with a total traveled distance less than 25, so print 25.

Sample Input 2

MGJYIZDKSBHPVENFLQURTCWOAX

Sample Output 2

223
